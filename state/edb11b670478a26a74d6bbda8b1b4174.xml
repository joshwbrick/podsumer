      <title>10/25/23 Meron Rapoport on Netanyahu’s Choice to Aid Hamas</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-25-23-meron-rapoport-on-netanyahus-choice-to-aid-hamas/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Israeli journalist Meron Rapoport about Netanyahu’s policy to prop up Hamas and the broader political ramifications of the current escalation. They begin by working through the history of the Israeli strategy to keep Hamas in power in an attempt to discredit the Palestinian Authority and pro-Palestinian advocates more broadly. Scott then asks Rapoport about the current geopolitical dynamic in the region and the political dynamic within Israel after the attacks. They end with some predictions about the impending invasion and the fate of Netanyahu. 
Discussed on the show:

“The End of the Netanyahu Doctrine” (Responsible Statecraft)

“Israeli Right: Keep Hamas In Power” (Lobeblog)

Scott's Twitter Thread: The Israeli Regime Likes It This Way Starter Pack 

Meron Rapoport is an investigative journalist and an editor at Local Call.

      <title>10/19/23 Arik Horowitz on What It's Like in Israel </title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-19-23-arik-horowitz-on-what-its-like-in-israel/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Arik Horowitz, who lives about thirty miles from Gaza, about how things are in Israel right now. He explains that the current consensus among Israelis is that Gaza must be leveled. But Horowitz attacks the common assumption underlying this consensus that indiscriminate bombings and total war are the only options for fighting Hamas. He instead calls for a ceasefire to contain the violence.

      <title>10/18/23 Hassan El-Tayyab on the Need for a Ceasefire in Gaza</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-18-23-hassan-el-tayyab-on-the-need-for-a-ceasefire-in-gaza/</link>
      <description>Scott brought Hassan El-Tayyab of the Friends Committee on National Legislation onto Antiwar Radio this week to discuss his organization’s push for a ceasefire in Gaza. El-Tayyab says the Hamas attacks of October 7th need to be unequivocally condemned. But on top of that, a ceasefire is necessary to contain the violence and prevent a wider war and a deadlier humanitarian crisis. He shares how you can help in this effort right now.

      <title>9/28/23 Matt Taibbi on the Origins of Russiagate and Government Censorship’s Legal Challenge</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-28-23-matt-taibbi-on-the-origins-of-russiagate-and-government-censorships-legal-challenge/</link>
      <description>Matt Taibbi was back on Antiwar Radio this week to discuss the origins of Russiagate and the major First Amendment case in front of the Supreme Court. They start with Russiagate and talk about what we know and don’t know about the DNC hack that the corporate press said was undoubtedly perpetrated by the Russian Government. Taibbi then draws on his experience reporting on the extensive government involvement in bringing about censorship on social media to analyze the corresponding case in front of the Supreme Court.
Discussed on the show:

Insane Clown President by Matt Taibbi

Hate Inc. by Matt Taibbi

“The Supreme Court Will Rule on Censorship” (Racket News)

“Forget Collusion. Was "Interference" Also Fake News?” (Racket News)

      <title>9/21/23 Ken Silva on FBI-Created Terrorist Plots and Nazi Groups</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-21-23-ken-silva-on-fbi-created-terrorist-plots-and-nazi-groups/</link>
      <description>Ken Silva joined Scott to discuss the recent acquittal of three men tied up in the FBI-created plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer. Silva gives some background on who these men are and how they fit into the overall plot. That leads to a broader discussion about the many terrorist schemes the FBI has concocted using informants planted in fringe groups from all sides of the political spectrum. They then talk about a story Silva has been digging into about an FBI informant who created one of the main Nazi groups active in the U.S. today. 
Discussed on the show:

The Alphabet Boys - Trevor Aaronson podcast

Video from the acquittal

“How an FBI Informant Created One of Largest Nazi Groups in U.S. History” (Libertarian Institute)

Ken Silva has been a reporter for more than 10 years, working in places such as the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, and the United States. Follow him on Twitter @JD_Cashless

      <title>9/21/23 Trevor Timm on Assange, the Espionage Act and Growing Pressure from the Australians</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-21-23-trevor-timm-on-assange-the-espionage-act-and-growing-pressure-from-the-australians/</link>
      <description>Trevor Timm of the Freedom of the Press Foundation joins the show to give an overview of the U.S.’s case against Julian Assange. They look back at why Obama was uncharacteristically reluctant to charge Assange. That brings them to the current case, brought by the Trump Administration and continued by Biden. They explain the case, debunk the common characterization of Assange as a hacker and finish with a quick look at why Australian officials may be the best chance for an Assange pardon. 
Discussed on the show:
“Prosecuting Assange threatens press freedom. US officials should not need the Australians to explain that to them” (Freedom of the Press Foundation)
Trevor Timm is a co-founder and the executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. He is a journalist, activist, and lawyer whose writing has appeared in the New York Times, The Guardian, USA Today, The Atlantic, and many others. Follow him on Twitter @trevortimm.

      <description>Scott was joined by Daniel Davis on Antiwar Radio this week to discuss the counteroffensive in Ukraine. They talk about why so many people have trouble admitting Ukraine is losing this war. They then look back at David Petraeus’ comments about the counteroffensive and observe how poorly they’ve aged. They also look at Zelensky’s visit before Davis gives his best estimate of the true number of casualties suffered so far. 
Discussed on the show:

“It's Time to Admit the Truth About the War in Ukraine—and Course Correct” (Newsweek)

“Zelensky’s ‘Bad Moment’” (Substack)

Daniel Davis did multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan during his time in the army. He is a Senior Fellow at Defense Priorities and is the author of the reports “Dereliction of Duty II: Senior Military Leaders’ Loss of Integrity Wounds Afghan War Effort” and “Go Big or Go Deep: An Analysis of Strategy Options on Afghanistan.” Find him on Twitter @DanielLDavis1.

      <title>9/7/23 Ted Galen Carpenter on Ukraine and the Call for War on Mexico</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-7-23-ted-galen-carpenter-on-ukraine-and-the-call-for-war-on-mexico/</link>
      <description>Scott was joined by Ted Galen Carpenter on Antiwar Radio this week. They first discuss the status of Ukraine’s counteroffensive. There has been a lot of coverage of some Ukrainian gains in the southeast. Less covered have been the Russian gains in the northeast. They discuss these developments and reflect on the reaction in Washington. At the end, they touch on the absurd GOP proposal to launch a conventional war against the Mexican drug cartels.
Discussed on the show:

“Is the United States Pursuing a Permanent Cold War with Russia? (Libertarian Institute)

“Russia as the New, All-Purpose US Pretext for Military Intervention” (Antiwar.com)

“Pakistan Events Confirm that Washington Prefers Compliant Autocrats Over Feisty Democrats” (Antiwar.com)

“The GOP Declares War on Mexico” (Antiwar.com)

Ted Galen Carpenter is a senior fellow at the Libertarian Institute. Carpenter has written 10 books including America’s Coming War with China: A Collision Course over Taiwan and most recently Unreliable Watchdog: The News Media and U.S. Foreign Policy. He is a contributing editor at The American Conservative Magazine and the National Interest.

      <title>8/31/23 Andy Worthington: Some Good News from Guantanamo Bay</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-31-23-andy-worthington-some-good-news-from-guantanamo-bay/</link>
      <description>Andy Worthington is back to discuss what’s happening down at Guantanamo Bay. This time there is a positive development. A judge has ruled that statements gathered from the so-called “Clean Team” interrogations of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri cannot be used against him. Scott gives some background on what the “Clean Team” interrogations were before the two discuss the specifics of al-Nashiri’s situation. They also detail how he was tortured. Finally, Worthington explains the status of the men who remain at Guantanamo.
Discussed on the show:

“Trial Judge Destroys Guantánamo’s Military Commissions, Rules That “Clean Team” Interrogations Cannot Undo the Effects of Torture” (Close Guantanamo)

The Convenient Terrorist by John Kiriakou and Joseph Hickman

Andy Worthington is the author of Guantanamo Files and the director of “Outside the Law: Stories from Guantanamo.” Read his work at the Future of Freedom Foundation and AndyWorthington.co.uk and follow him on Twitter @GuantanamoAndy.

      <title>8/31/23 Branko Marcetic on the Ousting of Imran Khan and Washington’s Plan for Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-31-23-branko-marcetic-on-the-ousting-of-imran-khan-and-washingtons-plan-for-ukraine/</link>
      <description>Branko Marcetic joined Antiwar Radio this week to talk about two articles he wrote recently. The first concerns the ousting of former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan in a no-confidence vote. U.S. officials and their friends in the media had said, emphatically, that the American government had no role in his removal. But a recently published cable appears to contradict that claim. Scott and Marcetic discuss. They then turn to the second article which examines the U.S. government’s apparent plan to extend the war in Ukraine, despite the failures of the counteroffensive.
Discussed on the show:

“Imran Khan’s Ouster Is a Story of US Power and Propaganda” (Jacobin)

“U.S.-Israel Plot Against Pakistan: A Desperate Imran Khan's Big, Bad Conspiracy Theory” (Haaretz)

“Are US officials signaling a new ‘forever war’ in Ukraine?” (Responsible Statecraft)

Branko Marcetic is a writer for Jacobin Magazine, a fellow at In These Times, and host of the 1/200 podcast. He is the author of Yesterday’s Man: The Case Against Joe Biden. Follow him on Twitter @BMarchetich.

      <title>8/10/23 Ted Snider on the Polish-Belarussian Tension</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-10-23-ted-snider-on-the-polish-belarussian-tension/</link>
      <description>Ted Snider joined Scott on Antiwar Radio this week to talk about some concerning developments in Eastern Europe. They start with the tensions on the Polish-Belarus border where forces have been building up since Wagner forces moved in after the Prigozhin ordeal. Snider goes over what’s happening and what it might mean. They then talk about the Neo-Nazi compound in Maine whose leader claims to be training forces to go fight in Ukraine. They finish with some of the disheartening language we’re hearing about the backchannel talks between U.S. and Russian officials.
Discussed on the show:

      <itunes:summary>Ted Snider joined Scott on Antiwar Radio this week to talk about some concerning developments in Eastern Europe. They start with the tensions on the Polish-Belarus border where forces have been building up since Wagner forces moved in after the Prigozhin ordeal. Snider goes over what’s happening and what it might mean. They then talk about the Neo-Nazi compound in Maine whose leader claims to be training forces to go fight in Ukraine. They finish with some of the disheartening language we’re hearing about the backchannel talks between U.S. and Russian officials.

      <title>8/3/23 Lyle Goldstein on True Costs of a Naval War with China</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-3-23-lyle-goldstein-on-true-costs-of-a-naval-war-with-china/</link>
      <description>Lyle Goldstein is back to talk with Scott about a recent U.S. wargame simulating a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. While Goldstein has some problems with the game’s design, he thinks it was far superior to most in its realism. And that, above all, the report authors were honest about the sheer scale of losses both sides face if diplomatic solutions dry up or go ignored.
Discussed on the show:

      <title>8/3/23 Jeff Deist on Recessions, Debt and BRICS</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-3-23-jeff-deist-on-recessions-debt-and-brics/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Jeff Deist to talk about both the problems facing our economy and the flawed economic ideas that brought us here. Scott and Deist discuss business cycles and inflation before turning more broadly to global currency markets. They finish with a look at the distinction between free international trade and subsidized international trade and examine the ways that the latter has unfairly discredited the former in the eyes of many right-wingers.
Discussed on the show:

Peter Schiff Mortgage Bankers Speech Nov/13/06

The chapter on Business Cycles from For A New Liberty by Murray Rothbard

Currency Wars by James Rickards

Debased Podcast with Jeff Deist

Jeff Deist is General Counsel of Monetary Metals. He previously worked as President of the Mises Institute, where he serves as a writer, public speaker, and advocate for property, markets, and civil society and as a longtime advisor and chief of staff to Congressman Ron Paul, for whom he wrote hundreds of articles and speeches.

      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-3-23-philip-weiss-on-the-american-zionists-breaking-with-netanyahu/</link>
      <description>Philip Weiss was back on Antiwar Radio this week to talk about the political situation in Israel. Or, more specifically, the reaction to the Israeli political upheaval.

Discussed on the show:

“‘Apartheid,’ says Tom Friedman” (Mondoweiss)

“Biden, Jayapal, and liberal Zionists rush to prop up the Israel lobby for 2024” (Mondoweiss)

“Awareness grows that Israel’s crisis stems from a core issue: it’s an apartheid state” (Mondoweiss)

“New Israeli law is shock to U.S. Zionists, who fear break with American Jews” (Mondoweiss)

      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/7-11-23-daniel-davis-on-the-counteroffensive-and-cluster-bombs/</link>
      <description>Scott was joined by Daniel Davis on Antiwar Radio this week to talk about Ukraine. In this interview, Davis gives an update on where things stand with the counter-offensive.

Scott and Davis unpack what’s being presented and think through the likeliest consequences if these ideas are adopted.

      <title>6/29/23 Tommy Salmons on ESG and RFK Jr.</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/6-29-23-tommy-salmons-on-esg-and-rfk-jr/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Tommy Salmons about the threat that the push for so-called Environmental, Social Governance (ESG) poses to our liberties. Salmons has dug deep into what ESG really is and who is behind it. He goes through what he’s found. He and Scott then zoom out and look at how this all fits into the broader political moment we found ourselves in. That leads to a discussion of Robert Kennedy Jr.’s run for President. 
Discussed on the show:

“‘ESG,’ the Threat to Liberty You Haven’t Heard Of” (Libertarian Institute)

“Who Cares Wins” (UN)

Confessions of an Economic Hit Man by John Perkins

Suicide of the West by James Burnham

RFK Jr.: The Reason Interview

      <title>6/29/23 Dave DeCamp on Ukraine’s Counteroffensive and Wagner’s “Revolt”</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/6-29-23-dave-decamp-on-ukraines-counteroffensive-and-wagners-revolt/</link>
      <description>Dave DeCamp was back on Antiwar Radio this week to give us an update on Ukraine. He and Scott start with Biden’s gaff where he called Ukraine “Iraq” which leads them to reflect on the hypocrisy of other U.S. officials who helped push for invading Iraq twenty years ago. DeCamp then gives a run-through on where things stand with Ukraine’s counteroffensive before jumping into the Wagner “revolt” last weekend. 
Discussed on the show:

“Lavrov: US, Russia in a ‘Fight of Worlds’” (Antiwar.com)

“Who Is National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, the Man Running US Foreign Policy” (Antiwar.com)

“36 Hours in Bakhmut” (Wall Street Journal)

      <title>6/23/23 Dana Rohrabacher the Tragic Return of U.S.-Russia Tension</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/6-23-23-dana-rohrabacher-the-tragic-return-of-u-s-russia-tension/</link>
      <description>Scott interviewed former Congressman Dana Rohrabacher at Porcfest. Rohrabacher, who also worked under President Reagan as a speechwriter and special assistant, had attended Scott’s speech on Ukraine expecting to disagree with everything Scott would say, but he had been pleasantly surprised. In this interview, he and Scott talk about the revival of U.S.-Russia tensions after the end of the Cold War, his decade-long stand to legalize marijuana, his night out drinking with Putin, his experience in Vietnam and more. 
Discussed on the show:
Not One Inch by M.E. Sarotte
Dana Tyrone Rohrabacher is a former American politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1989 to 2019. A Republican, he represented California's 48th congressional district for the last three terms of his House tenure. He also worked as a speechwriter and special assistant to President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1988.

      <title>6/15/23 Judge Andrew Napolitano on the Indictment of Donald Trump</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/6-15-23-judge-andrew-napolitano-on-the-indictment-of-donald-trump/</link>
      <description>Judge Andrew Napolitano joined Scott to discuss the DOJ’s case against Donald Trump. Napolitano believes it is an incredibly strong case and that the former President—and current Republican front-runner—is likely facing prison time. He and Scott run through what was revealed in the indictment, how it fits into what we already knew and why a lot of the common counterarguments from Trump fans likely won’t hold up in court.  
Discussed on the show:
“Judge Andrew Napolitano: The case against Donald Trump” (Orange County Register)
Andrew P. Napolitano, a former judge of the Superior Court of New Jersey, is the of the daily show Judging Freedom. Judge Napolitano has written seven books on the US Constitution. The most recent is Suicide Pact: The Radical Expansion of Presidential Powers and the Lethal Threat to American Liberty.

      <title>6/8/23 Ben Freeman on the Think Tanks Helping Weapons Companies Make Sales</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/6-8-23-ben-freeman-on-the-think-tanks-helping-weapons-companies-make-sales/</link>
      <description>Ben Freeman of the Quincy Institute joins the show to discuss his latest research on cronyism in American foreign policy. Freeman examined the top Think Tanks working to influence lawmakers in Washington and American public opinion through media. He found a lot of undisclosed funding coming from weapons companies. On top of that, many experts at these organizations were publicly for the purchase of the explicit weapons that their funders produced. Freeman lays out what he found and names some of the top organizations and companies taking part in this racket. 
Discussed on the show:

“How weapons firms influence the Ukraine debate” (Responsible Statecraft)

“Lockheed Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” (Corpwatch.com [formerly published at Playboy])

Ben Freeman is a Research Fellow at the Quincy Institute. He previously served as Director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative with the Center for International Policy. Read his work at Antiwar.com and Responsible Statecraft. Follow him on Twitter @BenFreemanDC.

      <title>5/18/23 Stephanie Savell on the Millions of Indirect Deaths Caused by the Post-9/11 Wars</title>
      <description>Scott was joined by Stephanie Savell of the Cost of War Project to discuss her organization’s new report on indirect deaths in America’s post-9/11 wars. Savell’s research now points to between 4.5 million and 4.6 million indirect deaths that have already occurred in the countries affected by the wars as an indirect result of U.S. intervention. In this interview, Scott and Savell discuss the methods used, what constitutes indirect deaths vs. direct deaths and how the devastation differed from country to country.

      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/5-4-23-joseph-solis-mullen-on-the-fake-china-threat/</link>
      <description>Scott was joined by Joseph Solis-Mullen to talk about the overblown fear of a global Chinese takeover. Solis-Mullen has been following the current wave of China fearmongering very closely and gives Scott an overview of what today’s hawks are saying. They then dig into the conflict over Taiwan and talk about the probability of an invasion, the popular talking points about microchips and how incredibly costly a war over the island would be. They finish with a quick rundown of the many domestic political, ethnic and geographic problems the regime in Beijing faces. 
Discussed on the show:

      <title>4/14/23 Erik Sperling: Don’t Underestimate America’s Ability to Ruin the Yemen Peace Talks</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/4-14-23-erik-sperling-dont-underestimate-americas-ability-to-ruin-the-yemen-peace-talks/</link>
      <description>Erik Sperling of Just Foreign Policy joins the show to talk about what’s going on in Yemen. There have been some very good developments there recently with peace talks, ceasefires and blockades being lifted. Overall, it appears that the Saudis are no longer interested in carrying out regime change in Yemen. That is a major step towards peace, but Sperling warns that there are still parties who want elements of this war to continue in some capacity.

      <title>4/13/23 Max Blumenthal: MSNBC Goes After the Twitter Files and Israel Descends into Violence</title>
      <description>Max Blumenthal joined Scott on Antiwar Radio this week to talk about Matt Taibbi’s interview on MSNBC and what’s going on in Israel. They start with Matt Taibbi, who has been the subject of some serious heat from the establishment after his reporting brought attention to the scale of government censorship happening on social media. They talk about Medhi Hasan’s failed attempt to discredit Taibbi’s revelations in an incredibly hostile TV interview. Next they move to Israel. Scott has done some interviews recently about the disturbing developments in Israeli politics, but things have recently turned violent. Blumenthal explains what’s happening and helps us understand what it all means.

      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/4-5-23-matt-taibbi-on-the-danger-of-digital-censorship/</link>
      <description>Scott was joined by Matt Taibbi this week on Antiwar Radio. They discuss some of Taibbi’s recent reporting on the government-NGO-corporate media joint effort to flag and suppress certain news and opinions that they deem to be disinformation. They take a step back and look at the broader context behind this story and discuss some evidence that the fight against this new digital censorship regime can work.

      <title>3/24/23 Ryan McMaken on Nuclear Weapons and How the Fed Fuels Inequality</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-24-23-ryan-mcmaken-on-nuclear-weapons-and-how-the-fed-fuels-inequality/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Ryan McMaken of the Mises Institute to talk about nuclear weapons and the boom-bust cycle. They begin with a discussion of McMaken's recent article pushing back against common arguments for the production of more nuclear weapons. McMaken argues that, even if you accept the premise that we need nuclear weapons for deterrence, it does not follow that we need thousands of them. They then move on to the economy. They first dig into what’s actually behind today’s inflation and looming recession. That leads to a broader discussion about why some of the most important goods and services, like housing and healthcare, are growing more expensive.
Discussed on the show:

“No, We Don't Need More Nuclear Weapons” (Mises Wire)

“The Fed Backtracks on Future Rate Hikes as Bank Failures Loom Large” (Mises Wire)

Mises.org

Ryan McMaken is a senior editor at the Mises Institute. He has degrees in economics and political science from the University of Colorado, and was the economist for the Colorado Division of Housing from 2009 to 2014. He is the author of Breaking Away: The Case of Secession, Radical Decentralization, and Smaller Polities and Commie Cowboys: The Bourgeoisie and the Nation-State in the Western Genre.

      <title>3/24/23 Ted Snider on the Rapidly Changing World Order</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-24-23-ted-snider-on-the-rapidly-changing-world-order/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Ted Snider to talk about the real-time shift we are living through from a unipolar order dominated by Washington to a multipolar world where different blocs engage on more equal footing. They start with the war in Ukraine where western officials are doubling down on some of the choices that have thrown Eastern Europe into chaos in the first place. They then zoom out and examine how Washington’s recent foreign policy has driven Russia and China closer together. That leads finally to a discussion about the ramifications of this Chinese-brokered deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
Discussed on the show:

Clip of Chris Murphy on CSPAN

“Does Canada Support Regime Change in Russia?” (Antiwar.com)

“The Minsk Deception and the Planned War in Donbas” (Antiwar.com)

“Putin and Xi Celebrate Ties Unbroken by Russia’s War in Ukraine” (New York Times)

“China Brokers Agreement Between Iran and Saudi Arabia, Sidelining United States” (Libertarian Institute)

Ted Snider has a graduate degree in philosophy and writes on analyzing patterns in U.S. foreign policy and history. He is a regular writer for Truthout, MondoWeiss and antiwar.com.

      <description>Kelley Vlahos returns to the show to talk about some of the writers, pundits and government advisors most responsible for the invasion of Iraq twenty years ago.

Discussed on the show:

“Setting the record straight on the teeming media swamp that supported Iraq” (Responsible Statecraft)

“Symposium: Aside from Bush &amp; Cheney who is at fault for the Iraq War?” (Responsible Statecraft)

Bad News: How the Media Marched Us to War in Iraq and Beyond

“What the Neocons Got Wrong” (Foreign Affairs)

“The Iraq War Reconsidered” (The Atlantic)

“The Iraq War, 20 Years Later” (Commentary)

“REVOLT AGAINST THE NEOCONS” (Antiwar.com)

“The Pentagon Muzzles the CIA” (The American Prospect)

      <title>3/24/23 Trita Parsi: America Is Not the Peacemaker in the Middle East</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-24-23-trita-parsi-america-is-not-the-peacemaker-in-the-middle-east/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Trita Parsi about an op-ed he wrote in the New York Times on the Saudi-Iranian agreement to reestablish diplomatic ties. Although the agreement does not mark an end to the rivalry between the two governments, it did establish a way to manage that rivalry with words. Also, the talks were brokered by the Chinese government. Parsi explains why this is a big deal. They also talk about the news that the Saudis agreed to resume ties with Syria in talks brokered by Russia. 
Discussed on the show:

“The U.S. Is Not an Indispensable Peacemaker” (New York Times)

“Saudi Arabia, Syria Close to Resuming Ties in Russia-Brokered Talks” (Wall Street Journal)

Trita Parsi is the Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and the author of Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy. Parsi is the recipient of the 2010 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order. Follow him on Twitter @tparsi.

      <title>3/24/23 Dan McKnight on Defend the Guard’s Victory in Arizona and How You Can Help Keep the Momentum Going This Monday</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-24-23-dan-mcknight-on-defend-the-guards-victory-in-arizona-and-how-you-can-help-keep-the-momentum-going-this-monday/</link>
      <description>Dan McKnight returns to the show to talk about Defend the Guard’s recent success in Arizona and how you can help bring about another victory this Monday in Texas. Defend the Guard is state-level legislation that bars Congress from deploying National Guard troops to foreign combat operations unless war is formally declared. In other words, it forces Congress to abide by the Constitution. McKnight lays the groundwork for where the fight stands right now after a victory in the Arizona Senate. Scott and McKnight then call for all listeners from Texas, or anyone who has friends or family in Texas, to take part in a phone bank operation this Monday, March 27th. McKnight provides the details on how you can get involved. Then, at the end, Scott plays the recording of his statement from the Defend the Guard hearing in Maine last Monday. 
Discussed on the show:

DefendTheGuard.us

BringOurTroopsHome.us

TenSevenClub.com

Arizona Petition

Montana Petition

Maine Petition

Texas Petition

DefendTheGuard.us/phonebank/

Dan McKnight is the founder and Chairman of Idahoans to Bring Our Troops Home. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves, three years active duty with the U.S. Army and ten years with the Idaho Army National Guard, including a one-year deployment to Afghanistan in 2006.

      <title>3/17/23 Grant F. Smith on How the Saudi-Iran Peace Initiative Is Bad for Israel</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-17-23-grant-f-smith-on-how-the-saudi-iran-peace-initiative-is-bad-for-israel/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Grant F. Smith about an article he recently wrote on the major blow the Saudis dealt Israel by reengaging with Iran.

“Israel and its US lobby Dealt Major Blow by China Saudi Iran Peace Initiative” (Institute for Research: Middle Eastern Policy)

How Israel Made AIPAC Podcast

Grant F. Smith is the author of a number of books including Big Israel: How Israel’s Lobby Moves America, Divert!, and most recently The Israel Lobby Enters State Government: Rise of the Virginia Israel Advisory Board.

        <![CDATA[<p>Scott talks with Grant F. Smith about an article he recently wrote on the major blow the Saudis dealt Israel by reengaging with Iran.

      <title>3/17/23 Kit Klarenberg on the Georgia Uprisings and the National Endowment for Democracy</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-17-23-kit-klarenberg-on-the-georgia-uprisings-and-the-national-endowment-for-democracy/</link>
      <description>Kit Klarenberg is back to provide some important context for the uprisings in Georgia. They start with the Eastern European country’s transition after the fall of the Soviet Union and the influence that the U.S. has enjoyed there since. That brings them to the recently proposed legislation that would have required Georgian organizations to disclose funding from any foreign governments. The proposal was met with sharp condemnation from Western officials who labeled it a threat to the Georgian people’s ability to fulfill their own economic and social aspirations. Scott and Klarenberg talk about how ludicrous this assertion is and pull back the curtain on what really explains the protests that erupted as a result.

      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-17-23-nasser-arrabyee-on-the-major-progress-towards-peace-in-yemen/</link>
      <description>Nasser Arrabyee is back to discuss the improving situation on the ground in Yemen. They talk about two huge developments, first that the Saudis have agreed to most of the Houthis’ requests in their negotiations to end the war, and second that the UAE is planning to start talks with the Houthis. Scott and Arrabyee dig into the implications of this progress, weigh the possibility that the U.S. will switch sides again to restart the drone war against Al-Qaeda and discuss the lingering effects of famine and disease on the Yemeni population. 
Discussed on the show:
“Suspected US Drone Strike Kills Three Alleged al-Qaeda Members in Yemen” (Antiwar.com)

      <title>3/10/23 Kevin Gosztola: They Lied About Iraq and Now They’re Lying About Assange</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-10-23-kevin-gosztola-they-lied-about-iraq-and-now-theyre-lying-about-assange/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Kevin Gosztola about a project he’s working on documenting the lead-up to Iraq War II as well as his brand new book about Julian Assange. To mark the twentieth anniversary of the disastrous invasion of Iraq, Gosztola has been writing about each day since mid-February, documenting the lies that the Bush Administration and their allies pushed exactly twenty years ago to the day. Scott and Gosztola talk about some of those lies before moving on to the current lies being told about Julian Assange. Gosztola talks about why he wrote this book and what sets it apart from some of the others already out. 
Discussed on the show:

March To Iraq War, 20 Years Later

Guilty of Journalism by Kevin Gosztola

Scott’s interview with Gabriel Shipton, Julian Assange’s brother

Ithaka (IMDb)


The Trial of Julian Assange by Nils Melzer 

“Inside the CIA's secret war plans against WikiLeaks” (Yahoo News)

      <title>3/10/23 Eli Clifton: The Weapons Companies are the Big Winners of the War in Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-10-23-eli-clifton-the-weapons-companies-are-the-big-winners-of-the-war-in-ukraine/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Eli Clifton of the Quincy Institute about some articles he wrote for Responsible Statecraft—the Quincy Institute’s publication. They begin with an article Clifton wrote about the fantastic year weapons companies had in 2022. Clifton has listened in on their calls to shareholders and reports that the way these companies present themselves to investors differs from how they present themselves to the public. They then talk about the absurd ways people are dismissing the reasonable concern about nuclear weapons as the U.S. embarks on a new era of Great Power Competition. 
Discussed on the show:

“Ukraine War is great for the portfolio, as defense stocks enjoy a banner year” (Responsible Statecraft)

“Game On” (Harper’s Magazine)

“Pro-bono Ukraine lobbyists quietly profit from defense contractor clients” (Responsible Statecraft)

      <description>Bonnie Kristian returns to the show to discuss a piece she wrote examining the foreign policy beliefs of the Florida Governor and likely Presidential candidate Ron DeSantis.

      <title>3/10/23 Daniel Larison on Biden’s Iran Policy, the Saudi-Iran Agreement and the House Vote on Syria</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-10-23-daniel-larison-on-bidens-iran-policy-the-saudi-iran-agreement-and-the-house-vote-on-syria/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Daniel Larison about Iran and Syria. They start with a column Larison recently wrote which highlights how the Biden Administration’s Iran policy makes no sense. Scott and Larison examine some of the frustrating contradictions in Biden’s approach which keep the economic war on the Iranian people in place while making a kinetic war in the region more likely. However, to what Scott says should be the embarrassment of the Administration, the Iranians and Saudis did just agree to reestablish diplomatic ties in talks brokered by Beijing. Scott and Larison discuss this major development before finishing with the House vote to end the war in Syria which failed last Wednesday.

      <title>3/10/23 Philip Weiss on the American Jews Waking Up to Netanyahu’s Extremism</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-10-23-philip-weiss-on-the-american-jews-waking-up-to-netanyahus-extremism/</link>
      <description>Philip Weiss joins the show to discuss developments concerning the Israeli government’s support among American Jews. They talk about a column written recently by Thomas Friedman, who is essentially a neoconservative who presents himself as a centrist liberal.

Scott and Weiss discuss the significance of this development and frame out the broader context of what’s happening. 
Discussed on the show:

“Netanyahu Is Shattering Israeli Society” (New York Times)

“American Jews, You Have to Choose Sides on Israel” (New York Times)

Scott’s interview with Jonathan Ofir

“A Threshold Crossed” (Human Rights Watch)

“Israel’s apartheid against Palestinians: a cruel system of domination and a crime against humanity” (Amnesty International)

      <title>2/27/23 Trita Parsi: Biden Opens the Door to War in the Middle East</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/2-27-23-trita-parsi-biden-opens-the-door-to-war-in-the-middle-east/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Trita Parsi who just wrote an article for Responsible Statecraft about the path to a new war breaking out in the Middle East. In the article, Parsi runs through the history of tension between Israel and Iran to demonstrate that, while certainly not being partial to Iran, the American government has often stepped in and pushed back against the worst of Israel’s warmongering. However, that is no longer the case. Parsi and Scott examine what geopolitical dynamics have changed to get us to a point where war could conceivably break out soon. 
Discussed on the show:

“By caving to Israel, Biden opens the door to war” (Responsible Statecraft)

“CIA Chief: Iran Not Resuming Nuclear Weapons Program” (Antiwar.com)

Trita Parsi is the Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and the author of Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy. Parsi is the recipient of the 2010 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order. Follow him on Twitter @tparsi.

      <title>2/24/23 Chas Freeman: America Needs to Use Diplomacy</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/2-24-23-chas-freeman-america-needs-to-use-diplomacy/</link>
      <description>Scott interviewed Chas Freeman about some of the biggest flashpoints that threaten to plunge the world into war. They discuss the war in Ukraine, the growing tension over Taiwan and even touch on the next conflict brewing in the Middle East. Freeman argues that the prospect for war with Russia or China depends on Washington’s willingness to sit down and work out a peaceful resolution. So far, the U.S. government has shown no such interest.
Discussed on the show:
“Why War Pledges for Ukraine Fell Flat in Munich” (Defense One)
Chas W. Freeman was Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs from 1993-94 and served as U. S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Follow him at his website, chasfreeman.net.

      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/2-23-23-andrew-cockburn-how-the-media-failed-julian-assange/</link>

      <title>2/17/23 Kit Klarenberg Refutes Myths About the Bosnian War</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/2-17-23-kit-klarenberg-refutes-myths-about-the-bosnian-war/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Kit Klarenberg to discuss an article he wrote about the Bosnian War. The article analyzes some declassified cables from Canadian Peacekeepers that give a window into what was actually happening on the ground. Klarenberg tells the story of the war for those who may be unfamiliar with it. Scott and Klarenberg then dissect some of the myths that persist today and observe a lot of parallels to later interventions, including today’s war in Ukraine. 
Discussed on the show:

“Declassified intelligence files expose inconvenient truths of Bosnian war” (The Grayzone)

“The Russian Military Unit That Killed Dozens in Bucha” (New York Times)

“Avoiding a Long War” (RAND)

“Blinken: Crimea a ‘red line’ for Putin as Ukraine weighs plans to retake it” (Politico)

“The West’s hardest task in Ukraine: Convincing Putin he’s losing” (CNN)

“Anatomy of a Coup: How CIA Front Laid Foundations for Ukraine War” (Substack)

      <description>Scott and Kyle Anzalone run through some of the big stories of the day. They start with the war in Ukraine where they discuss how the rhetoric by officials of both sides is evolving.

Russia Warns We Are Closing In On WWIII

“Blinken Warns Attempting to Retake Crimea Is a ‘Red Line’ for Putin” (Antiwar.com)

“Counting the Dead in Ukraine” (The American Conservative)

      <title>2/9/23 Dave DeCamp on the Bombshell Story about how Biden Bombed Nord Stream</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/2-9-23-dave-decamp-on-the-bombshell-story-about-how-biden-bombed-nord-stream/</link>
      <description>Dave DeCamp was back on Antiwar Radio this week to go over the major report by Seymour Hersh that details how a U.S.-Norwegian covert operation was responsible for the bombing of the Nord Stream pipelines last fall. Scott and DeCamp go through what Hersh reported and explain how the story compares to their initial expectations. They also revisit the absurd assertion made immediately by the legacy media hivemind that Russia must have bombed its own pipeline.

      <title>1/27/23 Ted Snider on the Missed Opportunities to Avoid War in Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-27-23-ted-snider-on-the-missed-opportunities-to-avoid-war-in-ukraine/</link>
      <description>Ted Snider is back to discuss his recent article for the Libertarian Institute. In it, Snider documents the many chances that were missed to avoid the war in Ukraine and a handful of opportunities to stop the war after Russia invaded. In this interview, Scott and Snider examine that history. They agree that the unnecessary nature of this war makes the present bloodshed that much more tragic. And that the war will probably end with similar conditions to what would have come about through talks and agreements before the war, which renders further fighting to be largely pointless.  
Discussed on the show:

“The Missed Opportunities of the War in Ukraine” (Libertarian Institute)

“Time is not on Ukraine’s side” (Washington Post)

“The U.S. Approach to Ukraine’s Border War Isn’t Working. Here’s What Biden Should Do Instead” (Politico)

“The First Months of U.S. Relations with the New Russia, 1992” (GWU National Security Archive)

“Diplomatic Cables Show Russia Saw NATO Expansion as a Red Line” (ACURA)

“Zelensky Flounders in Bid to End Ukraine’s War” (Foreign Policy)

“Fact Checking Zelensky on Non-Alignment” (Antiwar.com)

Ted Snider has a graduate degree in philosophy and writes on analyzing patterns in U.S. foreign policy and history. He is a regular writer for Truthout, MondoWeiss and antiwar.com.

      <title>1/27/23 Arthur Bloom on Don Reynolds and the Fast and Furious Scandal</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-27-23-arthur-bloom-on-don-reynolds-and-the-fast-and-furious-scandal/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with journalist Arthur Bloom about the case of Donald Reynolds. Reynolds is currently serving a life sentence plus 75 years in a Communications Management Unit (CMU), a prison for terrorists. But Reynolds is not a terrorist, he’s in on drug, weapons and money laundering charges. But Bloom does not find the case against Reynolds compelling. He explains why and gives his best guess for what’s really going on. Scott and Reynolds also examine the possible link between this case and the ATF’s Fast and Furious gunwalking scandal. 
Discussed on the show:

“The Knoxville Kingpin Who Wasn’t” (The American Conservative)

“More Odd Details in the Donald Reynolds, Jr. Case” (The American Conservative)

“A Response to John Kiriakou” (Arthuriana Substack)

Fast and Furious OAJ Report (2012)

      <title>1/27/23 James Bamford on the Many Failures of American Counterintelligence</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-27-23-james-bamford-on-the-many-failures-of-american-counterintelligence/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews James Bamford about some of the stories he collected for his new book about the collapse of America’s counterintelligence apparatus. They start with Russiagate and talk about how, while the government and media were screeching about imaginary Trump-Russia collusion, the UAE had two spies in the Clinton Campaign. They also talk about how the NSA lost half a billion classified documents containing methods later used for the WannaCry ransomware attacks of 2017, the former FBI counterintelligence agent who is now facing charges for working with the Russians, a group of former CIA and FBI guys who were accidentally hired to help a Russian coup attempt, the lack of accountability for the intelligence failures of Iraq War II, the framing of Maria Butina and the mole in the FBI who spent two decades transferring documents to the Chinese government in the most blatant fashion imaginable. 
Discussed on the show:

“The American intelligence community has no accountability — so how can it keep us safe?” (New York Post)

Spyfail by James Bamford

The Interview (IMDb)

“How an Oligarch May Have Recruited the F.B.I. Agent Who Investigated Him” (New York Times)

A Pretext for War by James Bamford

“How China planted an FBI mole who was discovered only after gutting the CIA's vast spy network” (Business Insider)

“These Shady UAE Donors Gave Millions to Clinton and Trump While the Feds Dozed” (Daily Beast)

James Bamford is a journalist, professor, documentary filmmaker, and the author of Spyfail: Foreign Spies, Moles, Saboteurs, and the Collapse of America's Counterintelligence, Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency and A Pretext for War: 9/11, Iraq, and the Abuse of America’s Intelligence Agencies.

      <title>1/27/23 Eric Margolis on the Rush to All Out War Over Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-27-23-eric-margolis-on-the-rush-to-all-out-war-over-ukraine/</link>
      <description>Eric Margolis returns to the show to talk about the war in Ukraine. Scott reflects on some of his early interviews with Margolis about Ukraine back in 2014. Just as he had said back then, Margolis sees some disturbing parallels between the modern tension in Eastern Europe and the build-up to World War One. Scott and Margolis talk about the mission creep happening with the West agreeing to send more and more provocative weapons while Russia claims sovereignty over territory it doesn’t even control. Notably, the two talk about how Crimea may be the big flashpoint. Margolis also points out that Washington is making all the same mistakes over Taiwan. 
Discussed on the show:

“America’s Pacific Century” (Foreign Policy)

        <![CDATA[<p>Ryan McMaken of the Mises Institute joins Scott to discuss the ill effects central banking has on the country. McMaken wrote an article recently pointing out that the Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, is technically bankrupt. Scott has McMaken explains how that’s true and why the costs of a bankrupt Fed are felt by us all. Scott and McMaken also address some common points about inflation made by the left and examine what they get right and where they go wrong.

      <title>1/27/23 Ted Snider: Were the Minsk Agreements a Lie?</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-27-23-ted-snider-were-the-minsk-agreements-a-lie/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Ted Snider about former German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s recent claim that the Minsk agreements were never meant to bring peace to the Donbas. Merkel said that instead, they were implemented to give Ukraine time to build up its military. Some are doubting whether Merkel’s comments are true, but Snider explains why this is a big deal whether she’s lying or not. Scott and Snider explore the dynamic around the Minsk agreements and examine the crucial years between the 2014 ousting of Yanukovych and the 2022 invasion. They also touch on where things stand today and on whether the best window for negotiation has already passed. 
Discussed on the show:

“Did Europe Lie to Russia About Peace?” (Antiwar.com)

“The U.S. Approach to Ukraine’s Border War Isn’t Working. Here’s What Biden Should Do Instead” (Politico)

“Did the West Miss Its Window?” (Antiwar.com)

“CIA director holds secret meeting with Zelensky on Russia’s next steps” (Washington Post)

Ted Snider has a graduate degree in philosophy and writes on analyzing patterns in U.S. foreign policy and history. He is a regular writer for Truthout, MondoWeiss and antiwar.com.

      <title>1/26/23 David Swanson on What Russia Could Have Done Instead of Invading Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-26-23-david-swanson-on-what-russia-could-have-done-instead-of-invading-ukraine/</link>
      <description>Scott brings on David Swanson to discuss the war in Ukraine. Scott and many of his guests have spent a lot of time explaining all the ways the U.S. and NATO unnecessarily backed Russia into a corner. But there are, in fact, plenty of things Moscow could have done to address the situation that didn’t involve invading Ukraine—which has only emboldened NATO and destroyed countless lives and livelihoods. Scott and Swanson also discuss the Rage Against the War Machine rally on February 19th in Washington DC where they will both be speaking.

      <title>1/26/23 Kyle Anzalone on Escalations over Ukraine and Zelensky’s “Anti-Corruption” Measures</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-26-23-kyle-anzalone-on-escalations-over-ukraine-and-zelenskys-anti-corruption-measures/</link>
      <description>Kyle Anzalone joined Scott on Antiwar Radio this week to go over some of the week's biggest stories. They talked about the German Foreign Minister’s admission that NATO is fighting a war against Russia. Of course we all know that’s the case, but Scott and Anzalone discuss why it’s a big deal that the FM said it out loud and on the record. They then talk about the deal to send heavy tanks to Ukraine and the immediate pivot made by Kyiv and its western supporters to now push for sending F-16 fighters. They put these escalations in context and also discuss weapons company lobbying, the Doomsday Clock and Zelensky’s apparent anti-corruption maneuvers. 
Discussed on the show:

“German FM Says ‘We are Fighting a War Against Russia’” (Antiwar.com)

“Lockheed Says It’s Ready With F-16s If US and Allies Choose to Send Them to Ukraine” (Antiwar.com)

Conflicts of Interest

      <title>1/19/23 Ara Sanjian Explains the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-19-23-ara-sanjian-explains-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict/</link>
      <description>Scott speaks with Ara Sanjian, an Associate Professor of History at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, about the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. This is an excellent interview for listeners unfamiliar with the situation. Scott and Sanjian go over the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict more broadly before focusing on the flare-up over Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020 and the state of things today. The conflict also has notable international implications with the Russian government backing Armenia and the Turkish government backing Azerbaijan. Scott and Sanjian explore the international ramifications of this dispute on an already messy world stage.  
Ara Sanjian is an Associate Professor of History and the Director of the Armenian Research Center at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. He received his master’s degree in history from Yerevan State University (1991) and PhD in Modern History of the Middle East from the School of Oriental and African Studies, the University of London in 1996.

        <![CDATA[<p>Scott speaks with Ara Sanjian, an Associate Professor of History at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, about the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. This is an excellent interview for listeners unfamiliar with the situation. Scott and Sanjian go over the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict more broadly before focusing on the flare-up over Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020 and the state of things today. The conflict also has notable international implications with the Russian government backing Armenia and the Turkish government backing Azerbaijan. Scott and Sanjian explore the international ramifications of this dispute on an already messy world stage.  </p><p>Ara Sanjian is an Associate Professor of History and the Director of the Armenian Research Center at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.

      <title>1/19/23 Branko Marcetic: Cables Expose Washington’s NATO Expansion Lies</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-19-23-branko-marcetic-cables-expose-washingtons-nato-expansion-lies/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Branko Marcetic about some cables he recently dug up that show U.S. officials and western governments voicing concern about Russia’s reaction to NATO expansion going back to the 1990s. Marcetic’s work adds to the evidence that shatters the argument that anyone connecting NATO expansion to the February invasion is either an amplifier or victim of a Russian disinformation operation. Scott and Marcetic go over what he found and zoom out to examine the broader context.
Discussed on the show:

“Diplomatic Cables Show Russia Saw NATO Expansion as a Red Line” (ACURA)

“Ignoring Gorbachev’s Warnings” (Current Affairs)

“‘Now or Never’: The Immediate Origins of Putin’s Preventative War on Ukraine” (Journal of Military and Strategic Studies)

Retired General Wesely Clark saying the US cannot let nuclear weapons deter its efforts

Branko Marcetic is a writer for Jacobin Magazine, a fellow at In These Times, and host of the 1/200 podcast. He is the author of Yesterday’s Man: The Case Against Joe Biden. Follow him on Twitter @BMarchetich.

      <title>1/13/23 Bjorn Handeen on Using Local Politics to End the Wars</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-13-23-bjorn-handeen-on-using-local-politics-to-end-the-wars/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Bjorn Handeen, a long-time listener who is now the Idaho Republican Party Region 1 Chairman. The two talk about Handeen’s efforts to translate his knowledge of American foreign policy into results by focusing on local politicians. Unlike some of the big names in today’s Congress, politicians on the county and state levels are often totally uninformed about international issues, which can make them relatively open-minded if only you’re able to get in their ear. Handeen says you’ll be surprised how much access you’ll get to local legislators if you just start showing up. They talk about when democratic institutions can be an effective tool in the non-interventionist effort. And they also look back and reflect on Scott’s early interviews. 
Discussed on the show:


The Sorrows of Empire by Chalmers Johnson 


Nemesis by Chalmers Johnson 

Newspapers.com

“Korean War at 69: Truman, Treaties, and the Bricker Amendment” (Antiwar.com)

Bjorn Handeen is the Idaho Republican Party Region 1 Chairman representing Boundary, Bonner, Kootenai, Shoshone and Benewah Counties. He’s also a longtime listener of the Scott Horton Show. Follow him on Twitter @BjornHandeen

      <description>Andy Worthington returns to talk about the 35 men who remain imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay as we pass the 21st anniversary of the prison.

Scott and Worthington talk about the shameful history of the prison, consider all the reasons it’s stayed open so long and discuss what must happen for this disgraceful chapter of America’s history to finally be brought to an end.

        <![CDATA[<p>Andy Worthington returns to talk about the 35 men who remain imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay as we pass the 21st anniversary of the prison.

      <title>1/12/23 Matt Taibbi on the Twitter Files, Russiagate and Government Censorship</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-12-23-matt-taibbi-on-the-twitter-files-russiagate-and-government-censorship/</link>
      <description>This week on Antiwar Radio, Scott talks with Matt Taibbi about the latest batch of Twitter Files, released seconds before Taibbi jumped on the line. To start, Scott asks Taibbi to respond to the claim he’s become a right-winger. They then dig into the new Twitter Files thread which details the company and government’s response to Tweets relating to Russiagate. Taibbi frames this new drop in the context of all that’s been revealed so far and explains the overarching theme—that the government made a clear shift from monitoring online platforms to working to control what is said on them.  
Discussed on the show:

“Twitter Files #14 THE RUSSIAGATE LIES” (Twitter)

Buying the War (IMDb)

      <title>12/30/22 David Hathaway on the Border, the Drug War and the OKC Bombing</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-30-22-david-hathaway-on-the-border-the-drug-war-and-the-okc-bombing/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews David Hathaway, the libertarian sheriff of Santa Cruz County, Arizona. Hathaway recently made news by calling attention to the video surveillance blimps that the border patrol is flying about a half mile north of the border with Mexico. Hathaway criticizes these blimps as infringements on the privacy of the people living in his county, who now have federal government cameras floating above their houses. They then talk about the immigration debate more broadly, and Hathaway makes the case for why right-leaning libertarians and conservatives should oppose a more militarized border. Next they discuss the failed war on drugs and the CIA’s relationship with the drug cartels. Hathaway brings in some insights from his experience working for the DEA to discuss the war on drugs and later the OKC bombing. The interview wraps up with a discussion of what it’s like being a voluntarist working as a county sheriff.

      <title>12/30/22 Ted Galen Carpenter on the Arrogance Behind Washington’s Foreign Policy</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-30-22-ted-galen-carpenter-on-the-arrogance-behind-washingtons-foreign-policy/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Cato Senior Fellow Ted Galen Carpenter about American interventions in Ukraine and Syria. They dig into the likeliest escalation scenarios in Ukraine and imagine how both sides would react to defeat. That leads to a discussion about the social psychology behind Washington’s foreign policy decisions. They also look to the terror wars and tie their talk on American foreign policy psychology to the ongoing war in Syria. 
Discussed on the show:

“How Will the Blob React if Ukraine Faces Defeat?” (Antiwar.com)

“What Do Think Tanks Think? Proximity to Power and Foreign Policy Preferences” (Foreign Policy Analysis)

“Washington’s Dubious Syria Intervention Continues” (Cato.org)


Ted Galen Carpenter is a senior fellow for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. Carpenter has written 10 books including America’s Coming War with China: A Collision Course over Taiwan and most recently NATO: Dangerous Dinosaur. He is a contributing editor at The American Conservative Magazine and the National Interest.

      <title>12/30/22 Eli Clifton on Twitter’s Hypocritical Acceptance of US Information Operations</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-30-22-eli-clifton-on-twitters-hypocritical-acceptance-of-us-information-operations/</link>
      <description>Scott brings Eli Clifton of Responsible Statecraft on to discuss the recent revelations about Twitter’s boosting of U.S. military information operations. They go over some of the details outlined in Lee Fang’s thread, which served as part 8 of the ongoing Twitter Files. Fang reveals Twitter’s hypocrisy as the firm publicly exposed and censored disinformation campaigns by foreign governments while it worked to amplify specific fake propaganda accounts at the request of the Pentagon. Scott and Clifton go through what we learned and then zoom out. Although they see a lot of value in these Twitter Files disclosures, the two also voice concern over the lack of action Musk appears to be taking beyond just exposing past behavior. They point out how financially dependent Musk is on the government which serves as a natural ceiling to how much he can expose and upset the military and intelligence agencies. They also talk about the enormous scale and efficacy of foreign lobbying on the government, DC think tanks and America’s largest companies. 
Discussed on the show:

“How Twitter hid US-military info ops from the public” (Responsible Statecraft)

“The Twitter Files Part 8: How Twitter Quietly Aided the Pentagon’s Covert Online PsyOp Campaign” (Twitter)

“DC think tank puts hawkish former Aussie PM on China Center board” (Responsible Statecraft)

Scott and Clifton go through what we learned and then zoom out. Although they see a lot of value in these Twitter Files disclosures, the two also voice concern over the lack of action Musk appears to be taking beyond just exposing past behavior. They point out how financially dependent Musk is on the government which serves as a natural ceiling to how much he can expose and upset the military and intelligence agencies. They also talk about the enormous scale and efficacy of foreign lobbying on the government, DC think tanks and America’s largest companies.

      <title>12/22/22 Connor Freeman: Biden Escalates Toward War With Russia</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-22-22-connor-freeman-biden-escalates-toward-war-with-russia/</link>
      <description>Scott’s first guest on Antiwar Radio this week was Connor Freeman, the Assistant Editor at the Libertarian Institute. They talk about the Ukrainian strikes deep in Russian territory, and the apparent green light Washington gave Kyiv to carry out more. Their reasoning? Putin hasn’t dropped a nuke yet, so there’s room to escalate. Scott and Freeman talk about the danger of this mindset and also touch on the recent Washington Post story about the lack of evidence that Russia attacked its own gas infrastructure back in September. 
Discussed on the show:

Rage Against the War Machine Protest

“Washington Erases Red Lines, Escalates Proxy War with Russia” (Libertarian Institute)

Antiwar News with Dave DeCamp

“Road to war: U.S. struggled to convince allies, and Zelensky, of risk of invasion” (Washington Post)

“For Western Weapons, the Ukraine War Is a Beta Test” (New York Times)

“No conclusive evidence Russia is behind Nord Stream attack” (Washington Post)

Connor Freeman is the Assistant Editor of the Libertarian Institute, primarily covering foreign policy. He is a co-host on Conflicts of Interest. His writing has been featured in media outlets such as Antiwar.com and Counterpunch, as well as the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity. You can follow him on Twitter @FreemansMind96

      <title>12/16/22 Jeffrey Kaye on US Bio-weapons and the CIA’s Attempts to Hide Them</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-16-22-jeffrey-kaye-on-us-bio-weapons-and-the-cias-attempts-to-hide-them/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Jeffrey Kaye about an article he recently published on the CIA’s effort to suppress reports about the use of bio-weapons by U.S. forces fighting in Korea. The agency went to great lengths to dismiss those rumors and claims as communist propaganda and the results of brainwashing. Then in 2010, the agency declassified documents that contained evidence of U.S. bio-weapons use in the Korean War. Kaye and Scott discuss the relevant history and why it’s important today. 
Discussed on the show:

“Secret Plan Revealed: CIA Told to ‘Destroy’ Those Supporting Communist Germ Warfare ‘Myth’” (Medium)

Human Smoke by Nicholson Baker

“Who Really Started the Korean War?” (Antiwar.com)

“False” Confessions Cover-up: U.S. Told Airmen Who Admitted Germ War in Korea They Could Reveal Information If Captured” (Medium)

M*A*S*H

Jeffrey Kaye is the author of Cover-up at Guantanamo: The NCIS Investigation into the “Suicides” of Mohammed Al Hanashi and Abdul Rahman Al Amri. Kaye is a retired psychologist, blogger, and author. Read his blog and follow him on Twitter @jeff_kaye.

      <itunes:summary>Scott talks with Jeffrey Kaye about an article he recently published on the CIA’s effort to suppress reports about the use of bio-weapons by U.S. forces fighting in Korea. The agency went to great lengths to dismiss those rumors and claims as communist propaganda and the results of brainwashing. Then in 2010, the agency declassified documents that contained evidence of U.S. bio-weapons use in the Korean War. Kaye and Scott discuss the relevant history and why it’s important today. 
Discussed on the show:

“Secret Plan Revealed: CIA Told to ‘Destroy’ Those Supporting Communist Germ Warfare ‘Myth’” (Medium)

Human Smoke by Nicholson Baker

“Who Really Started the Korean War?” (Antiwar.com)

“False” Confessions Cover-up: U.S. Told Airmen Who Admitted Germ War in Korea They Could Reveal Information If Captured” (Medium)

      <title>12/9/22 Philip Weiss on the Silver Lining of an Even Worse Israeli Government</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-9-22-philip-weiss-on-the-silver-lining-of-an-even-worse-israeli-government/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Philip Weiss about the political implications of an Israeli government run by Ben-Gvir, a far-right extreme zionist. Weiss gives a quick background on the volatile last five years of Israeli politics before the two jump into who Ben-Gvir is and what he may do when in power. To both, Ben-Gvir represents the worst of modern Israeli politics. But there may be some upsides too. 
Discussed on the show:

“Israel lobby’s realignment over Ben-Gvir is giving Biden room to criticize” (Mondoweiss)

Jordan Peterson interviews Benjamin Netanyahu

      <title>12/9/22 Daniel Larison on the Battle to Define Conservative Foreign Policy</title>
      <description>Scott is joined by Daniel Larison to discuss a piece he wrote recently that aims to rebut an article published in Foreign Policy. Larison criticizes that article, written by Nadia Schadlow, for using right-wing language to argue that conservatives have always and should always rally around the war machine in Washington. Scott and Larison talk about the absurdity of that position and observe how the opposite is true. 
Discussed on the show:

“The battle for who owns ‘conservative statecraft’” (Responsible Statecraft) 

“Conservative U.S. Statecraft for the 21st Century” (Foreign Policy)

A Republic, Not an Empire by Pat Buchanan

“George Packer’s attempt to carve up restraint is a real turkey” (Responsible Statecraft)

Scott’s debate with Bill Kristol

Taibbi’s Debate on the mainstream media

Daniel Larison is a contributing editor at Antiwar.com, contributor at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and former senior editor at The American Conservative magazine. Follow him on Twitter @DanielLarison or on his blog, Eunomia.

      <title>12/9/22 Misty Winston on the Global Push to Free Assange and How You Can Help</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-9-22-misty-winston-on-the-global-push-to-free-assange-and-how-you-can-help/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews activist and podcast host Misty Winston about the persecution of Julian Assange and those who are working to stop it. Winston first gives an update on what Assange is facing right now. They then talk about the letter from major publications like the Guardian and the New York Times calling for Assange’s release as well as Elon Musk’s popular Twitter poll. Scott and Winston find these developments hopeful and frustrating because of how long Assange has been maligned in the media while living under some form of custody. Lastly, Winston reviews the global network of activists campaigning for Assange and lays out how you can get involved in the effort.

Denver Action to Free Assange

      <title>12/2/22 John Young on Cryptome, Wikileaks and the Persecution of Julian Assange</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-2-22-john-young-on-cryptome-wikileaks-and-the-persecution-of-julian-assange/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with John Young of Cryptome.org about his attempt to join the Julian Assange indictment as a co-defendant. Before Wikileaks published redacted versions of the State Department cables leaked by Chelsea Manning, Cryptome got access and published the entire collection of unredacted cables. Young believes that his inclusion in the indictment would weaken the state’s case against Assange. Scott and Young also talk about the early days of Cryptome and the state of classified documents on the internet today. 
Discussed on the show:

Cryptome.org 
John Young is the cofounder of Cryptome.org, one of the earliest databases of classified documents on the internet.

      <title>12/2/22 Trevor Aaronson Gives a Window Into FBI Entrapment Schemes</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-2-22-trevor-aaronson-gives-a-window-into-fbi-entrapment-schemes/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews journalist and author Trevor Aaronson about an article he recently published for the Intercept. Aaronson has been one of the best reporters exposing how the FBI uses paid informants to manipulate people into agreeing to carry out violent attacks and other crimes so the agency can swoop in and pretend it’s taking dangerous terrorists off the street. His Intercept article examines one such case from about a decade ago. Scott and Aaronson dig into what happened. They then shift to a broader discussion of FBI entrapment schemes against both right and left-wing dissidents as well as financial criminals. Last, they reflect on the current political environment to question if there will ever be accountability for the FBI. 
Discussed on the show:

“The ‘Terrorist’, the Rapist, and Me” (The Intercept)

“U.S. Government Quietly Declassifies Post-9/11 Interview With Bush and Cheney” (The Intercept)

American ISIS Podcast Series

      <title>11/18/22 Hassan El-Tayyab on the War in Yemen and What We’re Doing About It</title>
      <description>Hassan El-Tayyab was back on Antiwar Radio Sunday to discuss the effort to end the war on Yemen. Scott and El-Tayyab have been advocating for the passage of two War Powers Resolutions (H.J.Res. 87 and S.J.Res. 56) in the two houses of Congress. In this interview, they discuss where things stand and what needs to get done. El-Tayyab argues that this lame-duck period in the House is the best time to get these resolutions passed.
Discussed on the show:

      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-18-22-daniel-mcadams-on-the-poland-missile-incident-and-prospects-for-negotiations/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Daniel McAdams to talk about the war in Ukraine. They start with the incident on Tuesday when a missile crossed into Poland, a NATO country, and killed two people on a farm. That leads to a discussion about the possibility of negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. McAdams argues against the idea that Republicans are about to turn against the provision of military support for Ukraine. Finally, they touch on the FTX situation.

      <title>11/14/22 Tim Shorrock: The Tension with North Korea is America’s Fault</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-14-22-tim-shorrock-the-tension-with-north-korea-is-americas-fault/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Tim Shorrock about the build-up to today’s tension with North Korea. Shorrock takes us back to the 1990s when the U.S. and North Korean governments were making serious headway in negotiating a formal end to the Korean war. At the time, the North Korean nuclear program was nonexistent. By the end of the decade, there were even serious talks taking place about ending the entire missile program. Then George W. Bush came in and, with the help of John Bolton, ruined everything. Scott and Shorrock talk about what went wrong, how it was almost fixed during the Trump administration and how things spiraled back out of control—again thanks largely to John Bolton.

      <title>11/11/22 David Stockman on the Economy and the Misplaced Fear of China</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-11-22-david-stockman-on-the-economy-and-the-misplaced-fear-of-china/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by David Stockman to talk about the economic issues facing the world today. To start, Stockman explains where the American economy stands today. He argues that the crash of 2020 represents the next stage in a 50-year evolution of the boom-bust cycle. They also touch on the labor markets, which Stockman argues are not doing as well as the news would have you believe. Next they turn to China, where Stockman says an accelerating slide back towards central planning that’s all built on an absurd level of debt should dispel the idea we’re headed for a world run by Beijing. He also debunks the myth that China has been waging an effective economic war on the U.S. since the 1990s. Instead, Stockman says America’s economic troubles are all the Fed’s fault. Lastly, Scott and Stockman take a step back and look at how the dollar is faring on a global scale. 
Discussed on the show:
David Stockman’s Contra Corner
David Stockman is the ultimate Washington insider turned iconoclast. He began his career in Washington as a young man and quickly rose through the ranks of the Republican Party to become the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan. After leaving the White House, Stockman had a 20-year career on Wall Street. He is the author of Trumped!, The Triumph of Politics, and his history of the financial crisis, The Great Deformation: The Corruption of Capitalism in America.

      <title>11/11/22 Branko Marcetic on the DHS’s Role in Online Censorship</title>
      <description>Scott is joined by Branko Marcetic of Jacobin to discuss the recent revelations that the Department of Homeland Security has been guiding tech platforms on what they should censor. They observe some specific cases where platforms like Facebook and Google changed rules and suppressed stories to help prop up the U.S. government’s narratives, even when they proved false. Scott and Marcetic also talk about the potential for cross-idealogical coalitions to fight back against these blatant and dangerous government interventions in the information space. 
Discussed on the show:

“The Quiet Merger Between Online Platforms and the National Security State Continues” (Jacobin)

“Leaked Documents Outline DHS’s Plans to Police Disinformation” (The Intercept)

They observe some specific cases where platforms like Facebook and Google changed rules and suppressed stories to help prop up the U.S. government’s narratives, even when they proved false. Scott and Marcetic also talk about the potential for cross-idealogical coalitions to fight back against these blatant and dangerous government interventions in the information space. </p><p><strong>Discussed on the show:</strong></p><ul>

      <title>11/11/22 Muhammad Sahimi on the Iranian Protests and the Risk of Foreign Intervention</title>
      <description>On Antiwar Radio this past Sunday, Scott was joined by Muhammad Sahimi to discuss the protests in Iran. Sahimi gives some background about how the brutal death of Mahsa Amini after she had been detained by Iranian morality police sparked protests led by the country’s younger generations. While both are supportive of the Iranian people in their resistance to the theocracy, Scott and Sahimi are also wary of the potential for foreign intervention to make the situation worse for everyone. They talk about which governments are already getting involved, what different factions in Iran are pushing for and examine the danger the U.S. government could turn this into another Syria. 
Discussed on the show:
The Murder of Mahsa Amini, Iranians’ Quest for a Democratic State, and the Role of Outside Forces” (Libertarian Institute) 
Muhammad Sahimi is a professor at the University of Southern California who analyzes Iran’s political developments, its nuclear program, and foreign policy.

      <title>11/14/22 Dave Decamp: Biden Meets Xi, Milley Calls for Talks with Russia and Biden Escalates in Somalia</title>
      <description>Dave DeCamp, the news editor at Antiwar.com, is back to run through some of the biggest foreign policy news of the day. He talks with Scott about Biden’s meeting with Chinese President Xi which appears to have been productive. Next they turn to Ukraine. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark Milley recently gave a talk where he voiced his support for negotiations with Russia. Scott and DeCamp talk about some other developments that may signal the potential for talks. Lastly, they turn to Somalia. The Biden Administration has been escalating the U.S. war in Somalia, and very few journalists are reporting on it. Scott and DeCamp discuss what’s happening there and reflect on how ridiculous it is that America is still waging this immoral and unnecessary war.

      <title>11/11/22 Grant F. Smith on Netanyahu, AIPAC and the ADL’s Influence on the FBI</title>
      <description>Scott talks with Grant F. Smith about the work he’s doing to track the ways Israel’s government tries to affect American politics. First, they talk about the return of Benjamin Netanyahu and how this could signal a disturbing shift in Israeli politics. They then move on to the fruitful effort by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC, to help pro-Israel candidates win elections last week. Lastly, they talk about some of the research Smith’s organization has done into the Anti-Defamation League’s influence over the FBI.

      <title>11/4/22 Douglas Macgregor on the Lost Opportunities to Leave Ukraine Better Off</title>
      <description>This week on Antiwar Radio, Scott talks with retired Colonel Douglas Macgregor about the war in Ukraine. From the beginning, Macgregor has been very critical of the Biden Administration’s myopic insistence on escalation. Now, it appears that a divide has broken out within Washington about how much further the U.S. and NATO can go. Scott and Macgregor discuss this evolving dynamic and reflect on all the missed chances for peace that would have left Ukraine with more territory and fewer lives lost. Now, with what appears to be a massive Russian offensive in the works, Macgregor says the west must put an end to the war as soon as possible. 
Discussed on the show:

“Playing at War in Ukraine” (The American Conservative)

“It’s Time to Bring Russia and Ukraine to the Negotiating Table” (New York Times)

“Will Biden Gamble on a Ukraine Coalition?” (The American Conservative)

Scott’s interview with Lyle Goldstein

Why is Ukraine the West's Fault? Featuring John Mearsheimer

Douglas Macgregor, Col. (ret.) is a senior fellow with The American Conservative, the former advisor to the Secretary of Defense in the Trump administration, a decorated combat veteran, and the author of five books.

      <title>11/4/22 Ted Snider: The US Admits Iran Isn’t Building a Nuclear Bomb</title>
      <description>Scott brings Ted Snider back on to discuss a major story that nobody but Antiwar.com appears to be covering. The Biden Administration recently declassified its Nuclear Posture Review where it is admitted that Iran is not working towards a nuclear bomb. After a quick discussion about how U.S. nuclear strike policy has evolved since the Cold War, Scott and Snider dig into this bombshell of a story. They reflect back on all the revelations that made it clear the Iran nuclear weapons program was a hoax. Now, this official acknowledgment really drives home how ridiculous all this chest-thumping has been. Scott and Snider finish with a quick discussion about how the U.S. has created and prolonged the nuclear tension with North Korea. 
Discussed on the show:

“US Admits Iran Is Not Building a Nuclear Bomb” (Antiwar.com)

The Threat by Andrew Cockburn

Manufactured Crisis by Gareth Porter

Losing an Enemy by Trita Parsi

“When the Ayatollah Said No to Nukes” (Foreign Policy)

“Iran, Islam, and Banning the Bomb” (Antiwar.com)

Ted Snider has a graduate degree in philosophy and writes on analyzing patterns in U.S. foreign policy and history. He is a regular writer for Truthout, MondoWeiss and antiwar.com.

      <title>10/31/22 Mike Swanson on our Strange and Troubling Economy</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-31-22-mike-swanson-on-our-strange-and-troubling-economy/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Mike Swanson about the economic mess we find ourselves in. Swanson helps us understand how we got here and why all the traditional “experts” have been so confused. Swanson argues that what happened in the UK with Liz Truss may indicate that governments are no longer able to rely on stimulus to delay economic pain. Scott and Swanson also look to history to help predict what the American economy will look like in the near future. 
Discussed on the show:

“Fed Seen Aggressively Hiking to 5%, Triggering Global Recession” (Bloomberg)

Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country by William Greider

      <itunes:summary>Scott talks with Mike Swanson about the economic mess we find ourselves in. Swanson helps us understand how we got here and why all the traditional “experts” have been so confused. Swanson argues that what happened in the UK with Liz Truss may indicate that governments are no longer able to rely on stimulus to delay economic pain. Scott and Swanson also look to history to help predict what the American economy will look like in the near future. 
Discussed on the show:

“Fed Seen Aggressively Hiking to 5%, Triggering Global Recession” (Bloomberg)

Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country by William Greider

      <title>10/31/22 Lyle Goldstein on the Danger of Fighting over Ukraine and Taiwan</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-31-22-lyle-goldstein-on-the-danger-of-fighting-over-ukraine-and-taiwan/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Lyle Goldstein about the danger posed by escalating conflicts in Europe and the Pacific. First Goldstein, who correctly predicted the February invasion, gives his account of where the war in Ukraine stands today and where it’s likely to go. He and Scott then talk about some of the important details for listeners to understand about nuclear weapons and nuclear war. Lastly, they discuss the growing tension over Taiwan. Goldstein is worried that the war in Ukraine mixed with the promise of greater western military aid for Taiwan years down the road will convince Beijing that now is the best time to invade the island. 
Discussed on the show:

“Threat Inflation, Russian Military Weakness, and the Resulting Nuclear Paradox: Implications of the War in Ukraine for U.S. Military Spending” (Cost of War Project)

“Don’t Rule Out Diplomacy in Ukraine” (Foreign Affairs)

Thirteen Days (2000)

Rumsfeld: His Rise, Fall, and Catastrophic Legacy by Andrew Cockburn

“The Scary War Game Over Taiwan That the U.S. Loses Again and Again” (Real Clear Investigations)

Lyle J. Goldstein is the Director of Asia Engagement at Defense Priorities. He is the author of Meeting China Halfway: How to Defuse the Emerging US-China Rivalry. Follow his work at The National Interest.

      <title>10/28/22 John Robb on the Geopolitical Ramifications of Elon Musk’s Twitter Takeover</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-28-22-john-robb-on-the-geopolitical-ramifications-of-elon-musks-twitter-takeover/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with John Robb about the major consequences of Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter. Robb has written about how the internet created a global geopolitical environment determined chiefly by the network effect. Notably, the hysteria surrounding the war in Ukraine is brought about by this network effect in both a top-down and bottom-up fashion. It seems that Musk intends to end the top-down suppression of dissent against the NATO narrative of the war. Scott and Robb discuss possible consequences and examine the broader effect this network has on American politics and foreign policy. 
Discussed on the show:

Global Guerillas

Apocalypse Now

Hate Inc by Matt Taibbi

John Robb is a former special operator who now writes the Global Guerrillas Report which examines the world at the intersection of war, technology and politics. Follow him on Twitter @johnrobb

      <title>10/27/22 Kyle Anzalone on Washington’s Incompetent Imperialism</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-27-22-kyle-anzalone-on-washingtons-incompetent-imperialism/</link>
      <description>Kyle Anzalone joins Scott this week on Antiwar Radio to provide a quick insight into the status of the American empire’s foreign adventurism. They first look to North Korea, where the Biden administration has reversed Trump’s policy of de-escalation and is instead undertaking nuclear brinksmanship for no good reason. Next, they turn to Taiwan and examine the push in Congress to abandon the stable status quo. They then look to Iran where the JCPOA is dead and Washington ineptly drives its enemies together in pursuit of world hegemony. They talk briefly about Yemen where the humanitarian crisis is picking back up post-ceasefire. Finally, they look to Ukraine where both sides are gearing up for a battle over the southern city of Kherson. 
Discussed on the show:

“Sanctions Relief and the 'Defensive Crouch'” (Substack)

“Yemen facing worst food crisis in four years” (The Cradle)

      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-24-22-ted-snider-on-americas-obligation-to-stop-the-war-in-ukraine/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Ted Snider about some of his recent articles at Antiwar.com. Snider makes the argument that, by deliberately ignoring off-ramps, the U.S. bears just as much responsibility for the ongoing war as any other party. But beyond that, Scott and Snider examine the ways the U.S. and NATO sabotaged Russo-Ukrainian negotiations shortly after the invasion — which Snider argues gives the U.S. an obligation to stop the war before more blood is needlessly spilled. 
Discussed on the show:

“The Back Door to NATO” (Antiwar.com)

“Choosing Sides in the New Cold War” (Antiwar.com)

“Who Stopped the War in Ukraine?” (Antiwar.com)

“Defense Secretary Tells Ukraine It Will Have ‘What It Needs to Defeat’ Russia” (Antiwar.com)

Ted Snider has a graduate degree in philosophy and writes on analyzing patterns in U.S. foreign policy and history. He is a regular writer for Truthout, MondoWeiss and antiwar.com.

      <title>10/22/22 Patrick MacFarlane on the Populist Right’s Taiwan Hypocrisy</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-22-22-patrick-macfarlane-on-the-populist-rights-taiwan-hypocrisy/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Patrick MacFarlane, the Justin Raimondo Fellow at the Libertarian Institute, to discuss an article he wrote recently as well as the new direction he’s taking his podcast Vital Dissent. Scott and MacFarlane first dig into the growing tension between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan's sovereignty. MacFarlane points out that some of the best opposition to both the policies that provoked Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and NATO’s subsequent response is from populist right-wingers. But those very same people throw all their logic out the window when the topic turns from Russia to China. 
Discussed on the show:

“Nothing But Welfare Queens: American Aid to Zelensky and Tsai Ing-wen” (Libertarian Institute)

Vital Dissent

Patrick MacFarlane is the Justin Raimondo Fellow at the Libertarian Institute where he advocates a noninterventionist foreign policy. He is a Wisconsin attorney in private practice. His work has appeared on antiwar.com and Zerohedge. Follow him on Twitter @patmacfarlane_

      <title>10/21/22 James Carden on the Need for Strategic Empathy</title>
      <description>This week on Antiwar Radio, Scott talked with James Carden about an article he co-wrote recently with Katrina vanden Heuvel of The Nation. The article compares the current level of tension between the U.S. and Russia with the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis sixty years ago. They argue that two factors make today’s flare-up more dangerous: a lack of communication channels and an absence of empathy for the other side. Carden explains why we do not need to sympathize with the Russian invasion to recognize that there is room for diplomacy. 
Discussed on the show:

“How did we avoid a Cuban Missile ‘Armageddon’? Strategic empathy.” (Responsible Statecraft)

American Committee for US-Russia Accord

James Carden is the executive editor for the American Committee for US-Russia Accord and former adviser on Russia policy at the US State Department. He is a contributing writer at The Nation.

      <description>Scott talks with Quincy Institute research fellow Annelle Sheline about the recent anti-Saudi sentiment in the Democratic Party and the effort to end the war in Yemen. After some tension between the Biden Administration and OPEC+, many Democrats have been directing anger toward the Saudi Regime. Scott and Sheline discuss how this came about and why the energy should be directed toward ending the war in Yemen.

      <title>10/21/22 Daniel Davis on the Looming Battle for Kherson</title>
      <description>Scott talks with Daniel Davis about the evolving situation on the ground in Ukraine. Davis has his eyes on the southern city of Kherson where the Russian forces are digging in for a Ukrainian attack. Clearly the Ukrainian forces have benefited from NATO weapons, but Davis thinks they’re in for a tough winter as Russia gets reinforcements and Ukraine’s armored divisions wither away. And so he expects the Ukrainians to try and take control of as much ground as possible before December. Scott and Davis also discuss how Russia’s annexations have changed the dynamic of this war. 
Discussed on the show:

“Biden’s Ukraine Strategy Could Start A Nuclear War With Russia” (19FortyFive)

“Inside the U.S. Effort to Arm Ukraine” (The New Yorker)

Daniel Davis did multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan during his time in the army.

      <itunes:summary>Scott talks with Daniel Davis about the evolving situation on the ground in Ukraine. Davis has his eyes on the southern city of Kherson where the Russian forces are digging in for a Ukrainian attack. Clearly the Ukrainian forces have benefited from NATO weapons, but Davis thinks they’re in for a tough winter as Russia gets reinforcements and Ukraine’s armored divisions wither away. And so he expects the Ukrainians to try and take control of as much ground as possible before December. Scott and Davis also discuss how Russia’s annexations have changed the dynamic of this war. 
Discussed on the show:

“Biden’s Ukraine Strategy Could Start A Nuclear War With Russia” (19FortyFive)

“Inside the U.S. Effort to Arm Ukraine” (The New Yorker)

      <title>10/20/22 Peter Van Buren: How Close to the Brink Are We Really? </title>
      <description>Scott interviews Peter Van Buren to talk through the risk of a nuclear detonation related to the war in Ukraine. Both Scott and Van Buren think the use of nuclear weapons is unlikely, but they dig into the differences in their views of the situation. They also explore how a conventional escalation could play out. Lastly, they turn to North Korea where Van Buren sees the greatest chance of nuclear disaster originating. 
Discussed on the show:

“Nuclear Chicken Is Overrated” (The American Conservative)

“Inside the U.S. Effort to Arm Ukraine” (The New Yorker)

“NATO Expansion: What Gorbachev Heard” (National Security Archive)

Fail Safe (1964)

“What Jefferson's Critics Miss” (The American Conservative)

“Who is Winning the War in Ukraine?” (The American Conservative)

Peter Van Buren worked for 24 years at the Department of State including a year in Iraq. He is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People and the novel Hooper’s War. He is now a contributing editor at The American Conservative magazine.

      <title>10/17/22 Richard Booth on Why the OKC Bombing is Still Important</title>
      <description>Richard Booth joins Scott to discuss the Oklahoma City bombing. The two go back to the beginning and talk about what originally got them interested in the bombing and how they later joined up to create the largest online archive of relevant documents. They then dig into why this story remains important almost thirty years later. Scott plays a number of audio clips to help the listener understand why there is clearly more to the story than the official conclusion would have us believe. But they also talk about instances where other researchers have gone too far with their assertions. This interview is a good jumping-off point for those who want to start learning about the bombing. 
Discussed on the show:

Oklahoma City Bombing Archive - The Libertarian Institute

Oklahoma City by Andrew Gumbel and Roger G. Charles

Aberration in the Heartland of the Real by Wendy Painting

Scott’s interview with Boltzmann Booty

“The Oklahoma City Bombing Surveiled: What Do the Videos Show?” (Libertarian Institute)

Tainting Evidence by Phillip Wearne and John Kelly 

The Oklahoma City Bombing and the Politics of Terror by David Hoffman

Kill Bin Laden by Thomas Greer

Bush at War by Bob Woodward

Brereton Report

“The Other Afghan Women” (The New Yorker)

      <title>10/14/22 Ted Galen Carpenter on the Danger of America’s Involvement in Ukraine</title>
      <description>Scott interviews author and Cato Institute senior fellow Ted Galen Carpenter about the dangerous situation in Ukraine. Carpenter has been paying close attention to the social psychology behind America’s response to Russia’s invasion. He talks with Scott about how dishonest journalism, partisanship and neo-McCarthyism have poisoned people’s ability to see the war for what it is and have made many Americans completely dismissive of the danger posed by war with Russia. Carpenter argues that broad outspoken opposition to American involvement in the war is vital. 
Discussed on the show:

“The Global South’s Revolt against Biden’s Russia Policy” (Antiwar.com)

“The NATO Vs. Russia Proxy War In Ukraine Could Become A Real War” (19fortyfive)

Ted Galen Carpenter is a senior fellow for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. Carpenter has written 10 books including America’s Coming War with China: A Collision Course over Taiwan and most recently NATO: Dangerous Dinosaur. He is a contributing editor at The American Conservative Magazine and the National Interest.

      <title>10/7/22 Boltzmann Booty on the CIA Asset who Funded the OKC Bombing</title>
      <description>Scott interviews Boltzmann Booty, a writer who recently wrote an article about possible CIA ties to the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995. It’s well known that Timothy McVeigh and accomplice Terry Nichols used money stolen from a man named Roger Moore to help fund the bombing. Later on, some research suggested that the robbery of Roger Moore was fake — that Moore used the theft to help fund the attack while keeping his hands clean. In this interview, Booty lays out some of the evidence that may suggest Moore himself was working with the government, specifically the CIA. 
Discussed on the show:

      <title>10/10/22 Medea Benjamin on the Need for Peace in Ukraine</title>
      <description>Scott interviews co-founder of CODEPINK Medea Benjamin about the antiwar movement and the risks brought about by the war in Ukraine. They start out with a discussion of how the antiwar movement has evolved since the George W. Bush years before digging into the need for off-ramps in the conflict against Russia. Benjamin argues the war fever in Washington is blinding the establishment to the risks and that the war-caused economic turmoil which lies ahead will breed unrest across the globe.

      <title>10/7/22 William Astore: There’s Something Rotten in the US Military</title>
      <description>Scott talks with William Astore about an article he penned recently in TomDispatch about the inner rot plaguing today’s U.S. military. Astore, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force, has observed an existential flaw that threatens the military from within — lies are rewarded while truthtellers are punished. In this interview, he and Scott take a step back and examine how this sprawling government bureaucracy has hijacked the noble instinct to protect one's community and used it to wage unjust wars of choice. 
Discussed on the show:

“Integrity Optional” (TomDispatch)

We Meant Well by Peter Van Buren

      <title>10/10/22 Dave DeCamp on Today’s Russian Missile Barrage </title>
      <description>Scott sits down with Antiwar.com news editor Dave DeCamp to discuss the Russian air strikes that hit targets across Ukraine earlier today. The two give some context to the strikes by examining the series of events that may have led to this escalation — including the Ukrainian bombing of a vital Crimean bridge and the assignment of a new Russian general to run the air campaign in Ukraine. Both agree that this attack represents a new phase in the war and reflect on how earlier negotiations would have resulted in fewer losses for Ukraine in territory, resources and lives. 
Discussed on the show:

“Biden calls the ‘prospect of Armageddon’ the highest since the Cuban missile crisis” (New York Times)

“The CIA Thought Putin Would Quickly Conquer Ukraine. Why Did They Get It So Wrong?” (The Intercept)

Zelensky’s “I am not some loser” moment

“Zelensky Calls for NATO to Launch Preemptive Strike on Russia” (Antiwar.com)

      <title>9/30/22 Jeff Deist on the State of the Economy</title>
      <description>Jeff Deist, president of the Mises Institute, is back to talk about the strange economic situation we find ourselves in. Deist observes that the issue with today’s economic discourse is the focus on GDP and employment. What really matters, he says, is productivity. Through that lens, Deist helps us interpret the warped economy that the government brought about through its historic levels of intervention during the pandemic. Deist and Scott also talk about the importance of opposing war, the most destructive government policy of all.

      <title>9/30/22 Judge Andrew P. Napolitano on Snowden and Assange</title>
      <description>Scott talks with Andrew Napolitano about the government crimes Edward Snowden and Julian Assange exposed. First, the judge gives some legal history and context to help us understand specifically what Snowden revealed back in 2013. That leads to a discussion of the sheer scale of illegal surveillance in which the intelligence agencies are engaged. They then turn to Julian Assange. Judge Napolitano goes over some history that highlights how absurd the legal arguments against Assange are. 
Discussed on the show:

“Edward Snowden: An American in Moscow” (Antiwar.com)

The Shadow Factory: The NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America by James Bamford

Andrew P. Napolitano, a former judge of the Superior Court of New Jersey, is the senior judicial analyst at Fox News Channel. Judge Napolitano has written seven books on the US Constitution. The most recent is Suicide Pact: The Radical Expansion of Presidential Powers and the Lethal Threat to American Liberty.

      <title>9/23/22 Douglas Macgregor on the Russian Escalation</title>
      <description>Scott is once again joined by Douglas Macgregor Col. (ret.) to discuss developments in Ukraine. Macgregor has been working hard to keep track of what’s actually happening on the ground, and the result is a very different narrative than what you’d find in most media outlets. Despite a very public “defeat” in northeastern Ukraine, Macgregor is convinced the Russians are dominating this war. He argues that Russia’s focus appears fixed on the southern coast, which may soon become part of Russia itself. Scott and Macgregor work through the current dynamics of the war and examine the risk of a nuclear strike. 
Discussed on the show:
“Playing With Fire in Ukraine” (Foreign Affairs)
Douglas Macgregor, Col. (ret.) is a senior fellow with The American Conservative, the former advisor to the Secretary of Defense in the Trump administration, a decorated combat veteran, and the author of five books.

      <title>9/20/22 Nasser Arrabyee on Why He’s Optimistic About the Yemen Ceasefire</title>
      <description>Scott speaks to Yemeni journalist Nasser Arrabyee. From the ground in Sana’a, Arrabyee gives his account of how six months of ceasefire has changed life in Yemen. He walks Scott through some of the improvements he’s observed. Most notably, he explains how the overall tone has changed, with parties from all sides feeling that it’s pointless to continue fighting. Although the agreed end date for the ceasefire is nearly here, Arrabyee is optimistic that the truce will not only continue, but expand.

      <title>9/19/22 William Hartung: The Arms Industry is Scamming You</title>
      <description>Scott speaks with William Hartung from the Quincy Institute about ways the arms industry is ripping off American taxpayers. They take a close look at a few cases such as the F-35 and the Littoral Combat Ship. Both weapons systems don’t work, but have made the manufacturers and their friends a lot of money. Scott and Hartung also take a step back and examine the overall dynamics of the military-industrial-congressional complex and how they use threat inflation and bad economic arguments to keep the money flowing into their pockets.  
Discussed on the show:

William Hartung is a Senior Research Fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and the author of Prophets of War: Lockheed Martin and the Making of the Military-Industrial Complex. Find him on Twitter @WilliamHartung.

      <description>Scott interviews Roger Waters, co-founder of the band Pink Floyd. They begin with a look back at how Waters first woke up to the plight of the Palestinians. That leads to a discussion about the persecution of Julian Assange, which Waters has been actively speaking out against. Next they look to the war in Ukraine and discuss Waters’ public back and forth with the first lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska. Lastly, Scott brings Waters up to speed on the effort to end the war in Yemen.

      <title>9/19/22 Philip Weiss on the Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh</title>
      <description>Scott talks with Philip Weiss about Shireen Abu Akleh, the Palestinian-American journalist slain by Israeli soldiers back in May. Likely because of her profession, the media has taken an unusually honest look at the events leading up to Abu Akleh’s death. Though it was always clear that she was unjustifiably killed by an Israeli sniper, further investigations have only made the IDF look worse. Weiss details what we now know, and lays out how the Israeli and American governments have responded. 
Discussed on the show:

Enough Already by Scott Horton

The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy by John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt

“Israelis justify killing of Shireen Abu Akleh — and Biden aides echo the talking points” (Mondoweiss)

“Israel’s denial of accountability for Abu Akleh killing may require cutoff of aid — Leahy” (Mondoweiss)

      <title>9/19/22 Daniel Davis on Ukraine’s Twin Offensives</title>
      <description>Scott talks with Daniel Davis about the situation on the ground in Ukraine. The news has been highlighting the recent Russian defeat in Northeastern Ukraine near Kharkiv. It has been less focused on the failed Ukrainian offensive in Southern Ukraine near Kherson. Davis has been working hard to sift through the media spin and state propaganda to determine what’s really happening on the front lines. In this interview, he shares some of what he’s found with Scott. 
Discussed on the show:

“Ukraine’s Twin Offensives Buy Ukraine Time, But May Not Be Enough To Beat Russia” (19fortyfive)

Moon of Alabama blog


Daniel Davis did multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan during his time in the army. He is a Senior Fellow at Defense Priorities and is the author of the reports “Dereliction of Duty II: Senior Military Leaders’ Loss of Integrity Wounds Afghan War Effort” and “Go Big or Go Deep: An Analysis of Strategy Options on Afghanistan.” Find him on Twitter @DanielLDavis1.

      <title>9/16/22 Michael Tracey on America First, NATO Expansion and the Shortage of Dissent in American Foreign Policy</title>
      <description>Scott talks with journalist Michael Tracey about the politics behind America’s foreign policy. Tracey recently attended a conference put on by the America First Policy Institute. Many Trump-friendly right-wing populists have defined their foreign policy philosophy as being “America First” with mixed understandings of the historical context behind that phrase. In many ways, this camp has represented a shift away from foreign interventionism within the American Right, at least concerning the Middle East and Europe. However, at the conference, Tracey found mostly establishment Republicans spewing hawkish nonsense. He talks with Scott about how, in many ways, the Trump Presidency brought about all the downsides of having a President willing to stand up to the war machine but with none of the upsides. 
Discussed on the show:

“America First Hawks Admit US Weapons in Ukraine are Plunging Down a Black Hole” (Substack)

“Transcript: Donald Trump Expounds on His Foreign Policy Views” (New York Times)


Reclaiming the American Right by Justin Raimondo 

America First Policy Institute

“Guided by British special forces, Ukraine is escalating the 'deep battlespace' fight against Russia” (Washington Examiner)

“Newt Gingrich's "outsider" act” (Salon)

“Tea Party welcomes Newt to New York” (Salon)

“Democrats and Republicans Pretend They Have Massive, Unbridgeable Differences So They Can Unite Seamlessly on War” (Substack)

“A Review of NATO’s War over Kosovo” (Chomsky.info)

      <title>9/11/22 Scott Explains the War in Yemen, and the Effort to End It</title>

      <title>9/6/22 Ramzy Baroud on the Deliberate Misrepresentation of Palestinians and the Siege of Gaza</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-6-22-ramzy-baroud-on-the-deliberate-misrepresentation-of-palestinians-and-the-siege-of-gaza/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Ramzy Baroud about two articles he wrote recently for Antiwar.com. The first examines the media’s role in distorting the truth about Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory. Scott and Baroud get specific, looking at how the subjugation is often falsely framed as a conflict where both sides are on equal footing. Next, they look at how the current situation in Gaza came about, which Baroud describes as a literal siege right out of the middle ages. 
Discussed on the show:

“Deliberate Misrepresentation: Western Media Bias Makes Israeli War on Palestinians Possible” (Antiwar.com)

Our Vision For Liberation by Ramzy Baroud

“15 Years of Failed Experiments: Myths and Facts About the Israeli Siege on Gaza” (Antiwar.com)

“The Gaza Bombshell” (Vanity Fair)

Ramzy Baroud is a US-Arab journalist and is the editor-in-chief of the Palestine Chronicle. He is the author of My Father Was A Freedom Fighter: The Untold Story of Gaza and The Last Earth: A Palestinian Story, These Chains Will Be Broken: Palestinian Stories of Struggle and Defiance in Israeli Prisons, and more. His new book is Our Vision For Liberation. Follow Ramzy on Twitter @RamzyBaroud and read his work at RamzyBaroud.net.

      <title>8/27/22 Trita Parsi on Biden’s Last Chance to Save the JCPOA</title>
      <description>Scott was joined by Trita Parsi to discuss JCPOA negotiations on yesterday’s Antiwar Radio show. Parsi recently published a piece in Foreign Affairs arguing that the U.S. should return to the deal and that the current negotiations are the final chance to reach an agreement. He observes that even if we don’t care at all about the well-being of the Iranian people, staying out of the deal is costing American taxpayers and businesses. Scott and Parsi examine the common arguments against the deal and show how they all fall apart upon closer examination. They conclude that the real reason hawks oppose the JCPOA is that it takes away their favorite excuse for war in the middle east. Parsi argues that everyone who actually wants peace should support reentrance into the deal and institutionalized communication between Washington and Tehran.

      <title>8/22/22 Hunter DeRensis on Loser Liz Cheney’s Awful Legacy </title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-22-22-hunter-derensis-on-loser-liz-cheneys-awful-legacy/</link>
      <description>Scott speaks with Hunter DeRensis about the legacy of Liz Cheney. Although the Wyoming Congresswoman recently lost her primary, she seems determined to take a shot at national office. But even if we’re not done with her yet, it’s still worth taking a look back at how terrible she’s been throughout her career. Scott and DeRensis explore some of her worst episodes: things like throwing her sister under the bus on gay marriage, aggressively defending torture, telling McCain to shut up about torture, labeling Guantanamo detainee lawyers as members of Al Qaeda, trying to use a War Powers resolution to keep U.S. forces in Afghanistan last year and more. 
Discussed on the show:

“Loser Liz Cheney: We knew ye, and that was the problem” (Responsible Statecraft)

“The ‘explosive’ Russian bounty story is so far, a dud” (Responsible Statecraft)

Willie Geist’s “I love Dick Cheney?” moment on MSNBC

VP Cheney’s Speech at VFW 103rd National Convention

      <title>8/19/22 Peter Van Buren’s “Neopracticalist” Take on Taiwan</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-19-22-peter-van-burens-neopracticalist-take-on-taiwan/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews writer and State Department veteran Peter Van Buren about Taiwan. Van Buren is sticking with his assessment that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan will not happen because there’s too much money to be lost if trade between China, Taiwan and the U.S. takes a hit. However, he does fault the American government for doing its best to escalate the conflict. In this interview, he talks with Scott about Pelosi’s visit, the early history of the Taiwan conflict, China’s current navy, the narrative that China is already waging economic war on the U.S. and more. 
Discussed on the show:

“How Does Asia Feel About Nancy Pelosi?” (The American Conservative)

“Nancy's Pointless Trip to Taiwan” (The American Conservative)

“Strategic Ambiguity Works” (The American Conservative)

China’s White Paper on Taiwan

American Factory (IMDb)

“Why Bombs Made in America Have Been Killing Civilians in Yemen” (New York Times)

“China: From Death Camp to Civilization” (LewRockwell.com)

Peter Van Buren worked for 24 years at the Department of State including a year in Iraq. He is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People and the novel Hooper’s War. He is now a contributing editor at The American Conservative magazine.

      <title>8/19/22 Shane McCarver Debunks Petraeus’s Lies in the Atlantic </title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-19-22-shane-mccarver-debunks-petraeuss-lies-in-the-atlantic/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Shane McCarver about an article he published last week at Antiwar.com challenging the wild assertions David Petraeus made in his Atlantic article earlier this month. Despite its length, Petraeus makes almost no concrete claims in his piece. Instead, he spends 10,000 words to make vague notions about grit and commitment that conveniently protect him from blame. One of the few specific arguments he does make, however, is that the U.S. should have supplied the Afghan National Army with more Russian-made MI-17 helicopters. McCarver was a soldier in Afghanistan working on this exact task up until the collapse of the ANA last summer. He explains to Scott why Petraeus’s argument that more helicopters could have prevented the Taliban’s victory is absurd. 
Discussed on the show:

“In Rebuke of the Dishonorable David Petraeus” (Antiwar.com)

“Afghanistan Did Not Have To Turn Out This Way” (The Atlantic)

Shane McCarver was a soldier in the United States army from 2013-2017. He worked as a logistics analyst on the DOD contract maintaining the MI-17 helicopters and the PC-12 fixed wing aircraft of the Afghan Air Force and Afghan Army Special Mission Wing from November 2018 until July 2021. He has since found honest work as a shipping coordinator for a manufacturer in Newport, New Hampshire.

      <title>8/19/22 Sheldon Richman on America’s Totalitarian Tax System</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-19-22-sheldon-richman-on-americas-totalitarian-tax-system/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews the Libertarian Institute executive editor Sheldon Richman about a column he put out last Friday. In it, he discusses the massive boost Biden’s spending bill gives the IRS. Richman explains why strengthening tax enforcement will disproportionally hurt non-wealthy Americans. That leads to a broader discussion of how totalitarian the tax system in the United States has become and how much worse it’s slated to get thanks to this expansion. 
Discussed on the show:

“TGIF: The Coming New and Improved IRS” (The Libertarian Institute)

“Lottery!” (IMDb)

Your Money or Your Life: Why We Must Abolish the Income Tax by Sheldon Richman

Sheldon Richman is the executive editor of the Libertarian Institute and the author of Coming to Palestine and America’s Counter-Revolution: The Constitution Revisited. Follow him on Twitter @SheldonRichman.

      <title>8/12/22 Daniel Davis on the Myth that Victory in Afghanistan Was Possible</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-12-22-daniel-davis-on-the-myth-the-victory-in-afghanistan-was-possible/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Daniel Davis about David Petraeus's latest attempt to rewrite the history of the war in Afghanistan. Davis knows firsthand how the war actually played out back when Petraeus was in charge because his job required him to travel all over the country. The mismatch between what he witnessed and how it was all being presented to the American people convinced him to break rank and go public. In this interview, he debunks the claim that the war in Afghanistan could have been won, and he rips the media for continuing to listen to men like Petraeus, whose history of lying about the war is not even controversial.
Discussed on the show:

“David Petraeus Is Wrong” (19fortyfive)

“Go Big or Go Deep” — Davis’s 2009 Report

Blunt Vietnam Vet Marine Tells You Exactly What Happened To Him

“The Afghanistan Papers” (Washington Post)

“Afghanistan Did Not Have to Turn Out This Way” (The Atlantic)

Daniel Davis did multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan during his time in the army. He is a Senior Fellow at Defense Priorities and is the author of the reports “Dereliction of Duty II: Senior Military Leaders’ Loss of Integrity Wounds Afghan War Effort” and “Go Big or Go Deep: An Analysis of Strategy Options on Afghanistan.” Find him on Twitter @DanielLDavis1.

      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-12-22-ben-freeman-on-how-taiwan-and-other-foreign-governments-control-american-foreign-policy/</link>
      <description>Ben Freeman is back to talk about who’s really influencing United States foreign policy. Freeman recently wrote a paper about the Taiwan lobby. He talks to Scott about how this Taiwan lobby was involved in making the recent Pelosi trip happen. Scott and Freeman talk about how we find ourselves in a situation where foreign governments have more influence on America’s policies than the American people and American business too. 
Discussed on the show:

“The Taiwan Lobby” (Center for International Policy)

“How the Taiwan lobby helped pave the way for Pelosi’s trip” (Responsible Statecraft)

“Bipartisan ‘Fighting Foreign Influence Act’ targets think tank funding” (Responsible Statecraft)

“The well-traveled road from member of Congress to foreign agent” (Responsible Statecraft)

“Feds accuse Brookings president Gen. Allen of illegally lobbying for Qatar” (Responsible Statecraft)

Ben Freeman is a Research Fellow at the Quincy Institute. He previously served as Director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative with the Center for International Policy. Read his work at Antiwar.com and Responsible Statecraft. Follow him on Twitter @BenFreemanDC.

Scott and Kristian discuss the state of the conflict and examine the war’s place in the Global War on Terror.

      <title>8/5/22 Dan McKnight on Defend the Guard’s Momentum and the Death of Zawahiri</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-5-22-dan-mcknight-on-defend-the-guards-momentum-and-the-death-of-zawahri/</link>
      <description>Dan McKnight of Bring Our Troops Home is back to give an update on the movement to pass Defend the Guard Legislation. Defend the Guard aims to prohibit the Federal Government from deploying National Guard troops to foreign combat operations without a formal declaration of war. The movement backing these bills is led by veterans of the Terror Wars who just want lawmakers to respect the oath they all swore to the Constitution. McKnight gives an update on the effort and explains how you can help out. They then discuss the drone strike in Kabul two weeks ago that allegedly killed Al Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri. If true, McKnight says the last genuine justification for a War on Terror is gone. 
Discussed on the show:

Defend the Guard

Bring Our Troops Home

Ten Seven Club

Leadership Class

Kill Bin Laden by Dalton Fury (Thomas Greer)

“This Air Force commando called in 688,000 pounds of bombs in one battle” (Task &amp; Purpose)

Pat McGeehan for House of Delegates 

Dan McKnight is the founder and Chairman of Idahoans to Bring Our Troops Home. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves, three years active duty with the U.S. Army and ten years with the Idaho Army National Guard, including a one-year deployment to Afghanistan in 2006.

      <title>8/5/22 Grant F. Smith on Isaiah Kenen and how the Israeli Government Formed AIPAC</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-5-22-grant-f-smith-on-isaiah-kennen-and-how-the-israeli-government-formed-aipac/</link>
      <description>Scott talked with author Grant F. Smith about his new podcast detailing the founding of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC. They also discuss how AIPAC has recently been getting more involved in U.S. elections. While some have framed this as an attempt for the ‘politically conservative’ organization to target progressive candidates, Smith argues politics has little to do with it. All that matters to AIPAC is the degree to which any given candidate supports sending money to Israel.   
Discussed on the show:
How Israel Made AIPAC Podcast
Grant F. Smith is the author of a number of books including Big Israel: How Israel’s Lobby Moves America, Divert!, and most recently The Israel Lobby Enters State Government: Rise of the Virginia Israel Advisory Board. He is director of the Institute for Research: Middle Eastern Policy in Washington, D.C.

      <title>8/5/22 David Pyne Shares the Views That Got Him Blacklisted by the Ukrainian Government</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-5-22-david-pyne-shares-the-views-that-got-him-blacklisted-by-the-ukrainian-government/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews David Pyne about the articles he wrote on the war in Ukraine that landed him on the Ukrainian regime's blacklist. Earlier this year, Pyne wrote a piece that contained a fifteen-point plan to stop the bloodshed and pull all Russian troops out of Ukraine. But because he argued Zelensky should concede on at least some of Putin’s demands, he was criticized as a propagandist on the Kremlin’s payroll and landed on the Ukrainian blacklist. Scott and Pyne go through his proposal and discuss the historical context behind this strange moment of hypocritical idealism and censorship in our foreign policy. 
Discussed on the show:

“Response to Ukrainian Government Decision to Include me on a List of 28 High-Profile Americans Accused of Promoting Russian Propaganda Narratives” (Substack)

“A Proposed Peace Plan to End the Russo-Ukrainian War” (Substack)

      <title>7/28/22 Douglas Macgregor on NATO’s Doomed Strategy in Ukraine </title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/7-28-22-douglas-macgregor-on-natos-doomed-strategy-in-ukraine/</link>
      <description>This week on Antiwar Radio, Scott was joined by retired Col. Douglas Macgregor to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine. Macgregor has been deeply critical of NATO’s reaction to the Russian invasion, which he calls impulsive. He says the leverage Russia holds over Europe’s energy supply is itself enough of a reason to avoid picking a fight. He predicts a painful winter for Europeans, especially Germans, as energy shortages threaten their access to heat. He then gets into some mistakes the Russians made such as the choice not to cut off gas supplies before turning to military action and, once the invasion had begun, not committing to hold captured territory permanently. While Scott and Macgregor agree that NATO’s intent is to fight until the last Ukrainian, Macgregor predicts that weak western economies will cause NATO’s support to dry up before Russian forces run out of steam. 
Discussed on the show:
“Worshipping Dead Horses” (The American Conservative)
Douglas Macgregor, Col. (ret.) is a senior fellow with The American Conservative, the former advisor to the Secretary of Defense in the Trump administration, a decorated combat veteran, and the author of five books.

He predicts a painful winter for Europeans, especially Germans, as energy shortages threaten their access to heat. He then gets into some mistakes the Russians made such as the choice not to cut off gas supplies before turning to military action and, once the invasion had begun, not committing to hold captured territory permanently. While Scott and Macgregor agree that NATO’s intent is to fight until the last Ukrainian, Macgregor predicts that weak western economies will cause NATO’s support to dry up before Russian forces run out of steam.

“Worshipping Dead Horses” (The American Conservative)
Douglas Macgregor, Col. (ret.) is a senior fellow with The American Conservative, the former advisor to the Secretary of Defense in the Trump administration, a decorated combat veteran, and the author of five books.

        <![CDATA[<p>This week on Antiwar Radio, Scott was joined by retired Col. Douglas Macgregor to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine. Macgregor has been deeply critical of NATO’s reaction to the Russian invasion, which he calls impulsive. He says the leverage Russia holds over Europe’s energy supply is itself enough of a reason to avoid picking a fight. He predicts a painful winter for Europeans, especially Germans, as energy shortages threaten their access to heat.

      <title>7/25/22 Matt Taibbi on the Depravity of the Media and Liberal Interventionists</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/7-25-22-matt-taibbi-on-the-depravity-of-the-media-and-liberal-interventionists/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews journalist Matt Taibbi about two articles he published at TK News. The first examines the role the New York Times plays in defining the boundaries of acceptable discourse in our country. Taibbi draws a comparison to the role of newspapers in the Soviet Union and points to multiple examples from the last few years of U.S. outlets doing the same thing. They then focus in on foreign policy, where they reflect on how the military and interventionists in both media and government went through a transformation after the Bush Presidency. By rebranding themselves as humanitarian interventionists and framing Obama as their leader, they were able to dismantle the antiwar left of the Bush years. Now we find ourselves in a moment where many on the right are taking a more anti-interventionist stance. Scott and Taibbi mull over whether this will, or can, change American foreign policy going forward. 
Discussed on the show:

“The New Kremlinology: Reading the New York Times” (TK News)

Scott’s Debate with Cathy Young

“Putin Misunderstands History. So, Unfortunately, Does the U.S.” (Bloomberg)

“The Great American Military Rebrand” (TK News)

The End of History and the Last Man by Francis Fukuyama

Bring Our Troops Home

      <title>7/25/22 Dave DeCamp on Ukraine, Taiwan, Iran and his New Podcast</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/7-25-22-dave-decamp-on-ukraine-taiwan-iran-and-his-new-podcast/</link>
      <description>Scott interviewed Antiwar.com News Editor Dave DeCamp earlier this week. First, they discussed DeCamp’s new podcast — Antiwar News with Dave DeCamp. The show runs every weekday and highlights the most important foreign policy headlines of the day. It’s an indispensable resource for anyone looking to stay up to date on the news without the dishonest spin of the mainstream corporate media. Scott and DeCamp then dig into how the war in Ukraine is progressing. They also touch on the escalating tension between the U.S. and China as Speaker Pelosi plans a visit to Taiwan. Lastly, they look to the Middle East, where the cold war between Israel and Iran continues to heat up.
Discussed on the show:

      <title>7/22/22 Jeff Deist on Inflation, the Housing Market and the Death of Savings</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/7-22-22-jeff-deist-on-inflation-the-housing-market-and-the-death-of-savings/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Jeff Deist, the President of the Mises Institute, to discuss the bizarre economic moment we are living through. Deist puts into perspective the historic levels of economic stimulus that the Federal Reserve injected into the economy in 2020. The intervention was unprecedented in both scale and speed, and we’re already feeling the effects. Scott and Deist talk about the state of housing markets and where in the past we should look to better understand where the economy is headed.  
Discussed on the show:

Episode where Bob Murphy and Jon Schwarz Debate Whether Inflation Is a Good Thing

      <title>7/22/22 Kyle Anzalone on the Ukraine-Russia Grain Deal and the Evolving State of the War</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/7-22-22-kyle-anzalone-on-the-ukraine-russia-grain-deal-and-the-evolving-state-of-the-war/</link>
      <description>Kyle Anzalone is back this week on Antiwar Radio to update us on all things Ukraine. Anzalone explains the grain deal both sides reached after Turkey hosted negotiations. If honored, the deal is expected to free up 22 million tons of wheat. Next, Anzalone lays out how the battle lines are evolving after Foreign Minister Lavrov announced Russia has expanded its objectives beyond the Donbas region. There’s also some good news about deals between Russia and the EU which will ease sanctions and open up the railroads into the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. However, the Biden Administration and Congress have been escalating their military support for Ukraine with promises to send more advanced weapons systems into the conflict. 
Discussed on the show:

“Russia and Ukraine sign breakthrough grain deal brokered by UN and Turkey” (Middle East Eye)

Scott’s Debate with Cathy Young about Ukraine

      <title>7/22/22 Doug Bandow on Biden’s Saudi Trip and Awful Middle East Policy </title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/7-22-22-doug-bandow-on-bidens-saudi-trip-and-awful-middle-east-policy/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Cato Institute Senior Fellow Doug Bandow about an article he wrote recently for The American Conservative. Bandow gives his take on Biden’s trip to Saudi Arabia. He thinks the Saudis were purposefully disrespectful to the U.S. President and that Biden just took it. Bandow explains the ways Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been changing how Saudi Arabia oppresses its people — rolling back religious tyranny while expanding political tyranny. Finally, Scott and Bandow take a step back and examine the Biden Administration’s approach to the entire Middle East region, which Bandow says is really just a continuation of Trump’s policies. 
Discussed on the show:

“Joe Biden Grovels to the Saudis” (The American Conservative)

“Biden says he confronted Saudis directly on Khashoggi” (The Washington Post)

Doug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and a regular contributor at Forbes Magazine, the National Interest, Antiwar.com, and elsewhere. He’s on Twitter @Doug_Bandow.

      <title>7/15/22 Patrick MacFarlane on Adrian Zenz and the 'Xinjiang Police Files'</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/7-15-22-patrick-macfarlane-on-adrian-zenz-and-the-xinjian-police-files/</link>
      <description>This week on Antiwar Radio, Scott is joined by Patrick MacFarlane to discuss the narrative that China is conducting a genocide against the Uyghurs of Xinjiang, its westernmost region. The narrative has become prominent over the past few years, especially with anti-China hawks. But MacFarlane shows that most of the “evidence” of genocide can be traced back to a German anthropologist named Adrian Zenz. Scott and MacFarlane dig into some of the obvious problems with Zenz’s work and put the U.S. Government’s connection to the Uyghurs in context. 
Discussed on the show:

“Credibility and the ‘Xinjiang Police Files’” (Libertarian Institute)

“The Red Line and the Rat Line” (London Review of Books)

Patrick MacFarlane is the Justin Raimondo Fellow at the Libertarian Institute where he advocates a noninterventionist foreign policy. He is a Wisconsin attorney in private practice. His work has appeared on antiwar.com and Zerohedge. Follow him on Twitter @liberty_weekly

      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/7-8-22-kyle-anzalone-on-recent-developments-in-ukraine/</link>
      <description>This week on Antiwar Radio, Kyle Anzalone of the Libertarian Institute and Antiwar.com joins Scott to discuss the status of the war in Ukraine. Anzalone explains how fighting has evolved in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine. He then moves down to Kherson in southern Ukraine as well as Snake Island off of the country’s southwest coast. They touch on the absurd amount of weapons and money Western governments have been sending to Ukraine as well as the accuracy of reported body counts. Finally, they talk about the lack of any real prospect for peace, and how the war will likely evolve as it grinds on.

      <title>7/8/22 John Kiriakou on Vault 7, Robert Grenier and Bin Laden’s Escape at Tora Bora</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/7-8-22-john-kiriakou-on-vault-7-robert-grenier-and-bin-ladens-escape-at-tora-bora/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by CIA officer turned whistleblower turned political commentator John Kiriakou to discuss the trial of Joshua Schulte, the man accused of leaking the CIA’s Vault 7 program to Wikileaks. Schulte denies being involved in the leak. His next trial is fast approaching. Kiriakou explains how the Justice Department also accused Schulte of having child pornography on his computer, although they walked it back when the judge requested they actually press charges. Scott and Kiriakou discuss past cases where the U.S. government weaponized false allegations of sexual crimes against whistleblowers. They then get into a discussion about former CIA officer Robert Grenier who Kiriakou worked with. He talks about their falling out. And any discussion of Robert Grenier is inevitably going to include Bin Laden’s escape into Pakistan at Tora Bora in December of 2001. Scott goes through some of the best books on the topic and Kiriakou gives his account of that critical time period from inside the Agency.

“A Whistleblower’s Agony” (Scheer Post)

      <title>6/23/22 Should the U.S. Be Sending Weapons to Ukraine? Scott Horton vs. Cathy Young at the Soho Forum</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/stress/should-the-u-s-be-sending-weapons-to-ukraine-scott-horton-vs-cathy-young-at-the-soho-forum/</link>
      <description>Should the U.S. give full military and political support to Ukraine in its war with Russia, short of sending troops?
That was the subject of a Soho Forum debate held on Thursday, June 23, at the Porcupine Freedom Festival, or PorcFest, in Lancaster, New Hampshire.
Cathy Young, a writer at the Bulwark and a contributing editor at Reason, is a Moscow-native who migrated to the U.S. as a teenager, argued that the U.S. government is correct to impose sanctions on Russia and to send military and economic support to Ukraine. 
Scott Horton, who's the host of Antiwar Radio, argued that U.S. backing of NATO provoked the Russian invasion and that imposing sanctions and sending weapons has brought more death and destruction.
He says the only role for the Americans is to call for an immediate ceasefire followed by negotiations.
The debate was moderated by Soho Forum Director Gene Epstein.

      <title>7/1/22 Diego Rivera on Defend the Guard and the Art of Effective Activism</title>
      <description>Scott interviews Diego Rivera, a veteran and activist, to talk about Defend the Guard legislation. The bill, which has been introduced in nearly all the State Legislatures, aims to block the deployment of National Guard troops to foreign combat operations unless Congress actually declares war. Rivera details the new initiative Bring Our Troops Home, the group behind Defend the Guard, is rolling out to train people in the art of effective political activism. Scott and Rivera discuss how seemingly powerless groups with no access can effectively bring about political change.

      <title>7/1/22 Shireen Al-Adeimi: The Ceasefire in Yemen is Not Enough</title>
      <description>Scott is joined by Shireen Al-Adeimi to discuss the war in Yemen. They talk about the War Powers Resolution in Congress and the Ramadan ceasefire, which is holding for now. Al-Adeimi points out that the Saudis dropping their support for former President Hadi was not actually a step towards peace. Instead, they turned to a “council” made up of rival warlords who appear destined to use violence in their disputes rather than diplomacy. But, she points out, the Saudis cannot exert any real control over Yemen without full military support from the United States. That defines a clear path for bringing this bloody period of foreign intervention in Yemen to an end.

There is currently a War Powers Resolution in the House of Representatives with a Senate version on the way.

      <title>6/27/22 Dan Steinbock: How Hawkish Democrats Make Money Pushing War</title>
      <description>Scott is joined by Dan Steinbock to discuss an article he wrote about the network of Democratic organizations running American foreign policy. Steinbock has dug deep into the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) and WestExec Advisors, two organizations that have allowed top foreign policy officials to make money cycling between government, think tank and advisory roles. Steinbock also takes a step back and examines how these organizations are connected to weapons companies, Wall Street and technology firms. 
Discussed on the show:

“The Centre of International Insecurity” (World Financial Review)

“Why Bombs Made in America Have Been Killing Civilians in Yemen” (New York Times)

Dr. Dan Steinbock is an internationally recognized strategist of the multipolar world and the founder of Difference Group. He has served at the India, China and America Institute (USA), Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (China) and the EU Center (Singapore). For more, see DifferenceGroup.net

      <title>6/27/22 Dave Decamp on Ukraine, NATO and Antiwar.com</title>
      <description>Scott interviews Antiwar.com News Editor Dave Decamp about the recent developments in Eastern Europe. First, they examine Lithuania closing the easement into Russia’s Kaliningrad territory. The move is a dramatic escalation that Scott and Decamp say points to the dangers of war guarantees. Next, they turn to the recent report in the New York Times about the CIA’s presence on the ground in Ukraine. Decamp echoes the Daniel McAdams argument that, by talking with the Times, CIA officials are likely attempting to pressure policymakers into changing Langley’s role in the war. They then touch on the latest developments in Finland and Sweden’s bid to join NATO. Lastly, they discuss the great work being done at Antiwar.com and how you can help support what Scott calls “the most important project on the internet”.

      <title>6/20/22 Ramzy Baroud on Israel, Palestine and Mali</title>
      <description>Scott is joined by journalist and author Ramzy Baroud to discuss the deterioration of Israeli Politics and the war in Mali. Israel will hold its fifth election in four years after yet another failure to form a government. Baroud gives some background on Israel’s issues and explains why they show that the ideals of its founders have collapsed. Scott and Baroud also discuss the war in Mali, examining how a seemingly simple intervention by NATO into Libya brought about deadly unanticipated consequences.

        <![CDATA[<p>Scott is joined by journalist and author Ramzy Baroud to discuss the deterioration of Israeli Politics and the war in Mali. Israel will hold its fifth election in four years after yet another failure to form a government. Baroud gives some background on Israel’s issues and explains why they show that the ideals of its founders have collapsed. Scott and Baroud also discuss the war in Mali, examining how a seemingly simple intervention by NATO into Libya brought about deadly unanticipated consequences. </p><p><strong>Discussed on the show:</strong></p><ul>

      <title>6/17/22 Kevin Gosztola: Julian Assange Extradition Approved by the UK</title>
      <description>Kevin Gosztola joined Scott on Antiwar Radio to discuss the most recent developments in the Julian Assange Case. Gosztola presents a primer on who Julian Assange is for those who are unfamiliar with him or who only know of the Collateral Murder video and 2016 election leaks. He then clarifies the charges brought against him. Last week, the UK approved Assange’s extradition to the United States. This is a step in the wrong direction, though it will give Assange’s team the opportunity to appeal and finally present some of their best arguments against his imprisonment. 
Discussed on the show:

“‘Another Dark Day’: UK Government Approves Assange’s Extradition to United States” (The Dissenter)

ABC Documentary on Assange

      <title>6/17/22 Max Blumenthal on Paul Mason and British Intelligence’s Crusade Against Independent Journalism</title>
      <description>Scott interviews Max Blumenthal about what’s been happening between Paul Mason and The Grayzone. Mason is a British Trotskyist turned Neocon who never stopped identifying with the left. He has built up a reputation in British media as a leftist while building relationships with British intelligence officials. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Mason decided to wage an all-out war on any media establishments that showed even a hint of skepticism towards the pro-NATO narrative of the war. The Grayzone, where Blumenthal works, was able to obtain emails revealing Masons coordinating with British officials as he planned his offensive against the publication. Scott and Blumenthal also discuss MI6’s involvement with Brexit and the situation with Julian Assange.
Discussed on the show:
“Paul Mason’s covert intelligence-linked plot to destroy The Grayzone exposed” (Grayzone)
Director and writer of “Killing Gaza,” Max Blumenthal is a senior editor of the Grayzone Project and the author Goliath, Republican Gomorrah and The 51 Day War. Follow him on Twitter @MaxBlumenthal.

        <![CDATA[<p>Scott interviews Max Blumenthal about what’s been happening between Paul Mason and The Grayzone. Mason is a British Trotskyist turned Neocon who never stopped identifying with the left. He has built up a reputation in British media as a leftist while building relationships with British intelligence officials. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Mason decided to wage an all-out war on any media establishments that showed even a hint of skepticism towards the pro-NATO narrative of the war.

      <title>6/17/22 Douglas Macgregor on the Lies Getting Ukrainians Killed</title>
      <description>Scott is joined by retired Col. Douglas Macgregor to discuss an article he wrote about the war in Ukraine. Macgregor points to the lies that got us into a situation earlier this year where a Russian invasion was inevitable and the lies that are allowing the war to grind on. He goes through how the Russian goal has shifted from one of Ukrainian neutrality to one of Russian annexation. Macgregor says there’s no going back to a Donbas region without Russian troops. The question now is: how do we end the fighting? 
Discussed on the show:

“When The Lies Come Home” (The American Conservative)

“When the secretaries of Defense and State said publicly the U.S. wants Ukraine to win and weaken Russia, Biden said tone it down” (NBC News)

Douglas Macgregor, Col. (ret.) is a senior fellow with The American Conservative, the former advisor to the Secretary of Defense in the Trump administration, a decorated combat veteran, and the author of five books.

      <title>6/3/22 Aisha Jumaan on How You can Help End the War Against Yemen</title>
      <description>Aisha Jumaan from the Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation joined Scott on Antiwar Radio to discuss the war in Yemen. Despite little to no media coverage, which Jumaan recently wrote about, the war in Yemen as well as the consequences of that war is the worst catastrophe happening in the world today. Even though progress has been made with a ceasefire, Jumaan reports on how the humanitarian crisis is getting worse. Together, they explain how you can help the grassroots effort to end U.S. support for the brutal war.

      <title>6/3/22 Hassan El-Tayyab: Some Good News on Yemen</title>
      <description>Hassan El-Tayyab came back on Antiwar Radio to give an update on the effort to end the war in Yemen. First, Scott and El-Tayyab discuss the last-minute extension of the two-month ceasefire. El-Tayyab reports that airstrikes have stopped completely and crucial fuel supplies have finally been allowed into the country. That said, there has still been some difficulty getting medicine in, although relief teams are working on the issue. They then turn to Congress, where some resolutions invoking the War Powers Act are gaining momentum. El-Tayyab shares some resources that can help you press your representatives to pass legislation that would make this ceasefire permanent.

      <title>6/3/22 Tom Secker on the Pentagon’s Control Over Top Gun: Maverick</title>
      <description>Scott interviewed British journalist Tom Secker about the Pentagon’s role in producing Top Gun: Maverick. The Department of Defense has an entire office set up to work with Hollywood. They give producers access to some military personnel as well as equipment in exchange for the final say over the script. Secker has gone through many documents over the years to find exactly what the military has changed in popular films. But with the Top Gun movies, the relationship is on a whole other level. Secker lays out the history of the first film, the sequel that got scrapped after the Pentagon pulled out in the 90s, and the eventual production of Top Gun: Maverick. Both Scott and Secker point out that they don’t have a problem with action movies like this being made, just that the military hijacks film productions in order to boost its reputation far beyond what it deserves. 
Discussed on the show:

“Documents Reveal How Pentagon Shaped ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ Into A Recruitment And PR Vehicle” (ShadowProof)

“Why does the Pentagon give a helping hand to films like ‘Top Gun’?” (Los Angeles Times)

Scott’s previous interview with Secker

      <itunes:summary>Scott interviewed British journalist Tom Secker about the Pentagon’s role in producing Top Gun: Maverick. The Department of Defense has an entire office set up to work with Hollywood. They give producers access to some military personnel as well as equipment in exchange for the final say over the script. Secker has gone through many documents over the years to find exactly what the military has changed in popular films. But with the Top Gun movies, the relationship is on a whole other level. Secker lays out the history of the first film, the sequel that got scrapped after the Pentagon pulled out in the 90s, and the eventual production of Top Gun: Maverick. Both Scott and Secker point out that they don’t have a problem with action movies like this being made, just that the military hijacks film productions in order to boost its reputation far beyond what it deserves. 
Discussed on the show:

“Documents Reveal How Pentagon Shaped ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ Into A Recruitment And PR Vehicle” (ShadowProof)

“Why does the Pentagon give a helping hand to films like ‘Top Gun’?” (Los Angeles Times)

      <title>5/25/22 Mark Thornton on Paper Money, Housing Bubbles and Free Trade</title>
      <description>Scott is joined by Mark Thornton, Senior Fellow at the Mises Institute, to discuss an article he wrote recently on the current housing bubble. They begin by discussing the damage that unbacked government-managed paper money does to the United States and the world. They relate that back to our current economic situation where we are feeling the effects of the enormous monetary expansion the Fed unleashed in 2020. Next, they turn to housing where Thornton, who was an early observer of the housing bubble that crashed in 2007, explains how that bubble has evolved into what we have today. Lastly, they discuss the virtues of free trade and the problems with government-run “free trade blocs.” 
Discussed on the show:

“The Fed's Latest Housing Bubble” (Mises.org)

“Housing: Too Good to Be True” (Mises.org)

“Biden's Baby Formula Airlift Stunt Should Never Have Been Necessary” (Reason)

Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country by William Greider

      <title>5/21/22 Hassan El-Tayyab: Now Is the Time to End the War in Yemen</title>
      <description>Hassan El-Tayyab of the Friends Committee on National Legislation joins Scott on Antiwar Radio to discuss the effort to end the war in Yemen. Both sides have agreed to a ceasefire which has brought the level of violence down and the access to food and commerce up. But the ceasefire is scheduled to end on June 2nd.

      <title>5/19/22 Patrick Cockburn on the Arrogance of War Hawks on All Sides</title>
      <description>Scott talks with Patrick Cockburn about Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Western response. Cockburn argues that, regardless of any media spin, the Russians are running into more trouble than they expected to in Ukraine. He chalks that up to hubris on the part of Putin and other high-level Kremlin officials. But at the same time, he points to that same hubris as driving western leaders in their decision to fund this proxy war against Russia.  
Discussed on the show:
“London and Washington are Being Propelled by Hubris – Just as Putin was” (CounterPunch)
Patrick Cockburn is a columnist for The Independent and the author of War in the Age of Trump.

      <title>5/16/22 Ben Freeman on the Links Between Foreign Governments and America’s Foreign Policy “Experts”</title>
      <description>Scott interviews Ben Freeman about the money governments like Saudi Arabia and Ukraine invest in D.C. lobbying. They begin by discussing the Middle East Institute, a Saudi-funded D.C. Think Tank that brands itself as an objective institution studying the Middle East when, in reality, its “experts” always happen to argue for what the Saudi regime desires. They then turn to the rest of the world and observe how awful and dangerous the rhetoric coming out of D.C. think tanks is concerning Russia and China.     
Discussed on the show:

“Gulf funded think tank turns pro-Saudi, UAE messaging up to 11” (Responsible Statecraft)

“Why the “end the Yemen war” narrative is problematic” (Middle East Institute)

“Army of Ukraine lobbyists behind unprecedented Washington blitz” (Responsible Statecraft)

“Tell us how this war in Ukraine ends” (Responsible Statecraft)

Ben Freeman is a Research Fellow at the Quincy Institute. He previously served as Director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative with the Center for International Policy. Read his work at AntiWar.com and Responsible Statecraft. Follow him on Twitter @BenFreemanDC.

      <title>5/16/22 Ted Snider: Did the CIA Oust Imran Khan?</title>
      <description>Scott is joined by Ted Snider to discuss the removal of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. Khan’s government announced in June of 2021 that Pakistan would no longer host any American military bases. Then, earlier this year, Khan was forced out by a vote of no confidence. He immediately turned around and blamed the United States, claiming his removal was a U.S. orchestrated coup. His claims garnered popularity in Pakistan. Snider decided to look into Khan’s theories. He shares what he’s found with Scott.

      <title>5/16/22 Ethan Siegel: How Hot Are Nuclear Bombs?</title>
      <description>Ethan Siegel joins Scott to discuss the science behind the temperature of thermonuclear explosions. Scott is putting together a new book that argues for the abolition of nuclear weapons called Hotter Than The Sun. He wanted to talk with an expert who can actually explain how the bombs are able to reach temperatures that far exceed the center of the Sun. Siegel wrote an article on that exact topic a few years ago, so he’s the perfect person to answer that question. At the end, they also talk about some of the things to avoid if you find yourself in the aftermath of a nuclear explosion.       
Discussed on the show:
“Ask Ethan: How Can A Nuclear Bomb Be Hotter Than The Center Of Our Sun?” (Forbes)
Ethan Siegel is an astrophysicist, author, professor and science communicator. He’s won numerous awards for science writing since he began blogging in 2008. His blog Starts With A Bang is now housed at Forbes. Follow him on Twitter @StartsWithABang.

      <itunes:summary>Ethan Siegel joins Scott to discuss the science behind the temperature of thermonuclear explosions. Scott is putting together a new book that argues for the abolition of nuclear weapons called Hotter Than The Sun. He wanted to talk with an expert who can actually explain how the bombs are able to reach temperatures that far exceed the center of the Sun. Siegel wrote an article on that exact topic a few years ago, so he’s the perfect person to answer that question. At the end, they also talk about some of the things to avoid if you find yourself in the aftermath of a nuclear explosion.

      <title>5/13/22 Jason Ditz: An Update on Iraq</title>
      <description>Jason Ditz, senior editor of Antiwar.com, joins the show to provide an update on what’s been happening in Iraq. They start with a look at Iraqi politics. An election was held in October, but the numerous factions have hit a wall in their attempt to form a government. That being said, Ditz does not think anyone is inclined to unilaterally seize power any time soon. Next, they turn to the recent Turkish offensive against the PKK in northern Iraq. Turkey claims they have the support of Iraqi officials, yet those same officials quickly came out against the campaign. Lastly, they touch on some intra-Shi’ite violence concerning gravesites that Ditz has been reporting on at Antiwar.com.     
NOTE: After recording the above episode, Iraq's political situation continues to deteriorate with Sadr now ruling out a consensus government. Read Jason Ditz's latest on the situation here.

      <title>5/13/22 Dave DeCamp on Congress, Ukraine and the Risk of Nuclear War</title>
      <description>Dave DeCamp is back on Antiwar Radio this week to provide another update on the war in Ukraine. They begin by talking about the new bill set to transfer $40 billion to Ukraine. Rand Paul requested an inspector general to oversee the funds, similar to how money was tracked during the war in Afghanistan. Paul’s request will not be included in the bill, but his attempt did push the passage of the bill back about a week. Scott and DeCamp point out how every single Democrat in national office has fallen in line to support this war. They then dig into the risk of nuclear war breaking out. Both agree that we are clearly on a bad trajectory with the express goals of western governments being to weaken or total overthrow the Russian regime — the top scenario nuclear war experts say will lead to a purposeful first strike. DeCamp points out that the only interest in negotiation seems to come from inside the military. Political leaders are outright discouraging talks. Scott and DeCamp end with a discussion of Finland and Sweden’s plans to join NATO and the Lithuanian Foreign Minister’s call for regime change in Moscow.   
Discussed on the show:

Mearsheimer’s short debate on PBS

“For the U.S., a Tenuous Balance in Confronting Russia” (New York Times)

“NATO says Ukraine to decide on peace deal with Russia — within limits” (Washington Post)

Stockman argues that the irrational motivator behind Washington’s actions is Trump-Derangement Syndrome — that Putin is a surrogate for Trump and you need to demonstrate blind hatred for him to be accepted. Next, they turn to the economy. Stockman recounts the trouble the American economy was in before the pandemic and war in Eastern Europe came about to make everything worse. Scott and Stockman end by discussing the painful path ahead.
Discussed on the show:

Mearsheimer’s short debate on PBS

Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country by William Greider

David Stockman is the ultimate Washington insider turned iconoclast. He began his career in Washington as a young man and quickly rose through the ranks of the Republican Party to become the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan. After leaving the White House, Stockman had a 20-year career on Wall Street. He is the author of Trumped!, The Triumph of Politics, and his history of the financial crisis, The Great Deformation: The Corruption of Capitalism in America.

      <title>5/9/22 Misty Winston on the Effort to Pardon Leonard Peltier</title>
      <description>Scott is joined by activist and podcast host Misty Winston to discuss the case of Leonard Peltier, an American Indian Movement member who was charged with killing two FBI agents in 1975. Supporters of Peltier argue that he was charged without sufficient proof and has thus been illegally held in a maximum-security prison for almost 47 years. Winston gives some background on Peltier’s case, the political and historical context that he was charged under and finally the effort to get him a presidential pardon— or at least a new trial. Winston directs the audience to some resources to learn more and also explains this week’s campaign to fill up the White House’s comment phone line with calls to pardon Leonard Peltier.

      <title>5/6/22 Stephen Walt: A Realist’s Take on the War in Ukraine</title>
      <description>Stephen Walt joined Scott for Antiwar Radio this week to give his view of the war in Ukraine. Walt is one of the leaders of the doctrine known as “foreign policy realism.” He starts by explaining what separates the realists from other schools of thought in the foreign policy space. He then ties those insights into the current war Russia has launched on Ukraine. He ends by explaining what will lead to escalation, and what has to happen in order for the war to end.
Discussed on the show:

The Israel Lobby

The Hell of Good Intentions

Stephen Walt is Professor of International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School, and the author of Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy. He is a regular contributor to ForeignPolicy.com. Follow him on Twitter @stephenWalt.

      <title>5/6/22 John Kiriakou on the War on Alternative Media</title>
      <description>Scott is joined by CIA whistleblower John Kiriakou to discuss the recent uptick in deplatforming efforts against alternative media sites like Consortium News and MintPress News. They discuss the hold that the Intelligence Community has over establishment national security “journalists.” The example of Ken Dilanian comes up, the journalist who reported on the CIA, but who sent every draft to the CIA for approval before even sending it to his own editor. Meanwhile, alternative websites like The Grayzone, Consortium News, MintPress News and Antiwar.com get no access and are quickly labeled as unstable conspiracy theorists. Recently, the deplatforming attempts against these sites have ramped up with the new “misinformation” labeling group NewsGuard. Scott and Kiriakou agree that this is the logical consequence of the attempt to ruin Jullian Assange, but also that it could be an act of desperation.

      <title>5/2/22 Douglas Macgregor on New Russia and “Hatred in the Plural”</title>
      <description>Scott interviews Retired Colonel Douglas Macgregor about the war in Ukraine. Scott recently interviewed William Arkin who believes the Russians are actually losing this war. Macgregor has a very different take, and Scott gives him the opportunity to address Arkin’s argument. Macgregor shares his view of how the war has unfolded so far and how he expects it to evolve. He believes the Russians will pivot and attempt to occupy Eastern and Southern Ukraine. He thinks a battle for Odessa is looming and that the Russians will succeed in this endeavor. Scott then asks about reports about the Biden Administration’s new overt intentions to fund another color revolution in Belarus. Macgregor gives his take on how it may happen and then predicts that the Kremlin will respond with similar attempts in Latin America. Lastly, Scott and Macgregor talk about some of the institutional barriers facing those who want to change the foreign policy status quo in Washington. 
Discussed on the show:

Scott’s Interview with William Arkin

Manufacturing Consent by Noam Chomsky

Douglas Macgregor, Col. (ret.) is a senior fellow with The American Conservative, the former advisor to the Secretary of Defense in the Trump administration, a decorated combat veteran, and the author of five books.

      <title>4/29/22 Jordan Smith on Melissa Lucio and the Pitfalls of Capital Punishment</title>
      <description>Scott is joined by investigative journalist Jordan Smith to discuss Melissa Lucio, a Texas woman awaiting execution. Smith walks us through Lucio’s case where the tragic death of her child was immediately assumed by police and prosecutors to be foul play. Smith’s reporting has uncovered the ways Lucio was misled and manipulated into falsely incriminating herself only hours after losing her child. Lucio narrowly avoided execution last week, but she still has a long fight ahead of her to avoid being killed by the State of Texas. Smith explains where things stand for Lucio going forward. 
Discussed on the show:

“Melissa Lucio’s Life Was Spared At The Last Minute, What Happens Now?” (The Intercept)

“How the flawed ‘science’ of bite mark analysis has sent innocent people to prison” (Washington Post)

Jordan Smith is an investigative journalist based in Austin, Texas. She has covered criminal justice for 20 years and is regarded as one of the best investigative reporters in Texas. A longtime staff writer for the Austin Chronicle, she now writes for The Intercept.

      <title>4/22/22 Mitchell Plitnick on Israel, Iran and a Cold War in the Middle East</title>
      <description>Scott interviews Mitchel Plitnick about Israeli politics and the Iran Nuclear Deal. Plitnick begins by filling us in on the political situation in Israel, where a new coalition government is working to agree upon a budget by the Fall of 2023. If they are unable to do so, the government will fall apart and new elections will take place. Next, they discuss the news about Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch labeling Israel an apartheid state due to their treatment of Palestinians. Plitnick and Scott give their theories for the abrupt change in tone. They then talk about the JCPOA, which is at risk of falling apart thanks to the Biden Administration’s reluctance to remove the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp from the terrorist list Trump placed them on. Scott and Plitnick observe that actually, the destruction of the deal will leave Iran’s nuclear activity unmonitored. Plitnick worries that we are on the road to a Cold War in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. 
Discussed on the show:

“How the Israeli government shake-up will affect US-relations” (Responsible Statecraft)

Manufactured Crises by Gareth Porter

Mitchell Plitnick is president of ReThinking Foreign Policy. His writing has appeared in Ha’aretz, the New Republic, the San Francisco Chronicle, and many other outlets, and he has regularly offered commentary in a wide range of radio and television outlets including PBS News Hour and the O’Reilly Factor.

        <![CDATA[<p>Scott interviews Mitchel Plitnick about Israeli politics and the Iran Nuclear Deal. Plitnick begins by filling us in on the political situation in Israel, where a new coalition government is working to agree upon a budget by the Fall of 2023. If they are unable to do so, the government will fall apart and new elections will take place. Next, they discuss the news about Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch labeling Israel an apartheid state due to their treatment of Palestinians. Plitnick and Scott give their theories for the abrupt change in tone. They then talk about the JCPOA, which is at risk of falling apart thanks to the Biden Administration’s reluctance to remove the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp from the terrorist list Trump placed them on. Scott and Plitnick observe that actually, the destruction of the deal will leave Iran’s nuclear activity unmonitored. Plitnick worries that we are on the road to a Cold War in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. </p><p><strong>Discussed on the show:</strong></p><ul>

      <title>4/22/22 Mike Swanson on Inflation and Economic Bubbles</title>
      <description>Scott interviews Mike Swanson about our current economic situation. Swanson starts by pointing out the historic nature of the economy in the middle of 2020 when interest rates and commodity prices were extremely low. Swanson explains how the inflation and volatility we are seeing today are the direct effects of early pandemic policies, not quick market reactions to the war in Eastern Europe as the Biden Administration wants us to believe. Swanson then focuses on the different sectors within the economy and gives his outlook on how they will act differently going forward. Scott and Swanson also discuss the political forces that are boxing politicians in while leaving everyday Americans confused and worried.

      <title>4/22/22 Peter Van Buren on the Elections of Post-Constitutional America</title>
      <description>Peter Van Buren is back on the show to discuss a number of articles he published about Russiagate and the Hunter Biden Laptop coverup. He and Scott run through the history of the coordinated effort to keep Trump out of the White House in 2016, and detail how the effort shifted to removing him from office after he won before finally settling on an attempt to “rein him in” that proved successful. That brings them to the 2020 election where the shadowy tactics used to propel Biden to victory over Trump were clear to see and even bragged about in a Time Magazine article. Van Buren warns that the story is not over. And that unless the American public shows uncharacteristic concern about intelligence bureaucrats working to sway elections, the process is bound to repeat in 2024. 
Discussed on the show:

“The Russiagate Hoax Goes Deeper Than We Thought” (Libertarian Institute)

“Thoughts For The Dead” (The American Conservative) 

“Revisiting Hunter Biden’s Laptop” (The American Conservative) 

“The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election” (Time)

“The Hunter Biden disinformation campaign” (Spectator World)

Peter Van Buren’s Soho Forum Debate on Taiwan

Peter Van Buren worked for 24 years at the Department of State including a year in Iraq. He is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People and the novel Hooper’s War. He is now a contributing editor at The American Conservative magazine.

      <title>4/22/22 Ryan McMaken on Capitalism and Peace</title>
      <description>Scott talks with Ryan McMaken about free markets and free trade. They begin with a discussion about the role of the Mises Institute in the push for sound money. Scott then asks McMaken about the nuances of debating capitalism vs. socialism while living under a mixed economy. They then discuss the changing role of the United States in the world. McMaken does believe a “rules-based international order” existed after the fall of the USSR. But that the U.S. destroyed it by invading Iraq in 2003. McMaken argues that the best path forward is a commitment to the classical liberal ideals of free markets at home and nonintervention abroad.

      <title>4/22/22 William Arkin on Russia’s Failures in Ukraine</title>
      <description>William Arkin joined Scott on yesterday's Antiwar Radio show to discuss the war in Ukraine. Arkin has spent the last two months following the war closely to try and get an accurate read on what’s happening on the ground. He shares his findings and latest analysis with Scott. Arkin believes that Russia’s military failures have exposed them as a paper tiger, invalidating all the money and resources that have been poured into NATO over the decades. At the same time, the absence of diplomacy and the apparent U.S. intentions to turn this conflict into a prolonged proxy war pose the greatest danger to Ukrainian civilians.

      <title>4/22/22 Kevin Gosztola on the Next Steps in the Assange Extradition</title>
      <description>Keven Gosztola returns to the show to give an update on Wikileaks founder Julian Assange’s legal situation. The British magistrate's court recently ordered Assange to be extradited to the United States. Gosztola walks us through how we arrived at this point and what the expected next steps are. Notably, the Assange legal team will get to appeal the U.S. government's near-certain acceptance of the extradition. The appeal will present Assange and his lawyers the opportunity to bring up a whole range of important issues that have so far gone unexamined. Chief among those issues is the concern for journalism and press freedom. Gosztola ends with an observation that even some organizations friendly to the U.S. national security establishment are beginning to express worry about the precedence this case may set. 
Discussed on the show:

      <title>4/15/22 Daniel Larison on the Deteriorating JCPOA Negotiations </title>
      <description>Scott interviews Daniel Larison about his recent article on the Iran Nuclear Deal negotiations. Before getting to that, Scott asks Larison about his reaction to the ceasefire in Yemen. Larison points out that nearly all ceasefires to occur in Yemen so far have actually been excuses for forces to regroup. However, he agrees with Scott that this one appears different. Next Scott and Larison go through the confusing and frustrating lack of progress in the negotiations for the U.S. to reenter the JCPOA. They talk about what’s going on and why, even though neither are concerned about Iran developing and using a nuclear weapon, they believe reentering the deal is the right path forward. The two also tie this topic into a broader conversation about Washington’s Middle East adventurism and the strange political forces shaping America’s Iran policy.  
Discussed on the show:

“Biden’s Last Chance on the Nuclear Deal” (Antiwar.com)

Scott’s interview with Nasser Arrabyee

“Yemeni Civil War Unleashes a Plague of Locusts” (Antiwar.com)

Manufactured Crisis: The Untold Story of the Iran Nuclear Scare by Gareth Porter

      <title>4/15/22 Nasser Arrabyee on the Ceasefire in Yemen</title>
      <description>On this week’s Antiwar Radio show, Scott talks with Nasser Arrabyee about the ongoing two-month Ramadan ceasefire in Yemen. Scott begins with a quick recap of how the war broke out. He then gets into his discussion with Arrabyee. Arrabyee, who lives in Sana’a, gives an on-the-ground account of the ceasefire so-far, and explains why it’s the best development since the war began seven years ago. Although these developments are great news for those who want peace, Yemen remains a very divided country. Scott and Arrabyee examine the political situations that will need to be addressed whenever the war truly comes to an end. 
Discussed on the show:
“In Strategic Shift, U.S. Draws Closer to Yemeni Rebels” (Wall Street Journal) 
Nasser Arrabyee is a Yemeni journalist based in Sana’a, Yemen. He is the owner and director of yemen-now.com. You can follow him on Twitter @narrabyee.

Arrabyee, who lives in Sana’a, gives an on-the-ground account of the ceasefire so-far, and explains why it’s the best development since the war began seven years ago. Although these developments are great news for those who want peace, Yemen remains a very divided country. Scott and Arrabyee examine the political situations that will need to be addressed whenever the war truly comes to an end. </p><p><strong>Discussed on the show:</strong></p><ul><li>“In Strategic Shift, U.S. Draws Closer to Yemeni Rebels” (<a href="https://archive.ph/41rHx#selection-1123.0-1123.54">Wall Street Journal</a>) </li></ul><p>Nasser Arrabyee is a Yemeni journalist based in Sana’a, Yemen.

      <title>4/14/22 Jim Bovard on the Michigan Acquittals, Terrorism Entrapments and the FBI’s All-Around Awfulness </title>
      <description>Scott talks with Jim Bovard about the recent acquittals in the Michigan Kidnapping case and FBI entrapments in general. Bovard explains how the Supreme Court changed the definition of entrapment which allowed federal agents to take more active roles in organizing the plots they would later use to arrest and charge participants. Bovard and Scott discuss how the FBI really kicked up these operations to target young Muslim men after 9/11. Now as the government pivots to so-called domestic terrorism, there’s no indication that the tactics have changed.  
Discussed on the show:

“Inside the FBI’s infiltration and entrapment of a Michigan militia crew” (NY Post)

“A Stunning Surprise In The Michigan Kidnapping Case Calls The Government’s Domestic Terror Strategy Into Question” (Buzzfeed News)

The Terror Factory by Trevor Aaronson

“Uncle Sam Wants You” (Playboy)

“Two Types of Terror in Michigan” (AIER)

“Inspector general's report on FBI and Clinton's emails shows secrecy threatens democracy” (USA Today)

“After the FBI's Pulse nightclub failure, why should we trust James Comey anymore?” (USA Today)

Scott’s 2004 interview with FBI whistleblower Frederic Whitehurst

      <title>4/7/22 Dave DeCamp on Russia’s Pivot East and the Overt Western Information War</title>
      <description>Dave DeCamp returned for another Antiwar Radio last Sunday to update us on the Russian war in Ukraine. DeCamp and Scott talk about the apparent Russian strategy of using operations in the North to draw Ukrainian forces away from the East. They discuss whether these claims appear accurate or if, as western media would have us believe, this is really the Russian excuse for suffering major military defeats at the hands of Ukrainian forces. They next discuss some revelations that came out last week about NATO leaders openly prioritizing vague power games over Ukrainian lives and about how the Biden Administration has admitted to releasing “low-confidence” intelligence in its information war efforts against the Kremlin. Lastly, they discuss Zelensky’s comments about the Azov Batallion on FOX, which the network later tried to hide. 
Discussed on the show:

“NATO says Ukraine to decide on peace deal with Russia — within limits” (Washington Post)

“In a break with the past, U.S. is using intel to fight an info war with Russia, even when the intel isn't rock solid” (NBC News)

Bret Baier asks Zelenskyy about Azov Batallion

Bandow attended the annual Doha Forum and observed a shift in tone away from “Pax Americana.” Scott and Bandow talk about how the severe U.S. sanctions on Russia’s central bank are accelerating the fall of the dollar as governments around the world realize the financial leverage the status quo gives the U.S. government.

      <title>3/31/22 Ken Silva on the FBI's Infiltration of Right-Wing Groups in the 1990s</title>
      <description>Scott interviews Epoch Times reporter Ken Silva about two articles he recently published that explore PATCON, an undercover FBI operation that began in the 1990s and targeted right-wing groups. The operation is still shrouded in mystery, but details have surfaced over the years. Scott and Silva talk about why PATCON is still making news today and discuss the possible ties with the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City. 
Discussed on the show:

“PATCON Explored: Records Provide Glimpse of FBI Right-Wing Infiltration Ops” (Epoch Times)

“FBI’s Operation to Infiltrate Right-Wing Extremist Groups Lies at Center of Transparency Lawsuit” (Epoch Times)

Libertarian Institute: OKC Bombing Archive

Aberration in the Heartland of the Real: The Secret Lives of Timothy McVeigh by Wendy Painting

News Broadcast about the unreleased surveillance tape

Ken Silva covers national security issues for The Epoch Times. His reporting background also includes cybersecurity, crime and offshore finance – including three years as a reporter in the British Virgin Islands and two years in the Cayman Islands.

      <title>3/31/22 Kyle Rempfer on the 2018 Death of Wahedullah Khan, an Afghan Detainee</title>
      <description>Scott interviews journalist Kyle Rempfer about a piece he recently published in the Army Times. The article tells the story of Wahedullah Khan, an Afghan commando who was taken into custody in 2018 after firing on Czech coalition troops. Khan was first interrogated by Green Berets, then the Czechs, and finally Afghan National Army troops. During these interrogations, Khan was beaten to death. Rempfer explains that it’s been too difficult to pin the responsibility on anyone specifically enough to bring charges. But the involvement of Green Berets was enough to lead to disciplinary action. 
Discussed on the show:
“Eight Green Berets quietly disciplined after Afghan prisoner’s beating death” (Army Times)
Kyle Rempfer is an editor and reporter at Military Times who has covered combat operations, criminal cases, foreign military assistance and training accidents. Before entering journalism, Kyle served in U.S. Air Force Special Tactics and deployed in 2014 to Paktika Province, Afghanistan, and Baghdad, Iraq. Follow him on Twitter @Kyle_Rempfer

      <title>3/31/22 Lyle Goldstein: This War Is a Disaster for Russia, Ukraine and the Entire World</title>
      <description>Scott talks with Lyle Goldstein about the war in Ukraine. Although Goldstein did expect some kind of Russian invasion to take place, he’s been surprised by the difficulty Russia has faced on a number of fronts. Scott and Goldstein discuss a number of theories and takes they’ve been reading across the media landscape. Among the topics covered are the global dangers posed by reductions in Ukrainian farming, Washington’s alleged interest in supporting a long-term insurgency, and the intentional drought in Crimea— which Goldstein says is an often omitted reason behind the invasion. They also talk about the danger of nuclear war, which both agree is higher than many seem to believe. Lastly, they touch on how China has reacted to the invasion, and how much President Xi may have known about Putin's plan to invade.   
Discussed on the show:

“The New Indo-Pacific Strategy is Too Shallow” (Defense News)

“Remembering Nixon’s visit to China after half a century” (Asia Times)

Lyle J. Goldstein is the Director of Asia Engagement at Defense Priorities. He is the author of Meeting China Halfway: How to Defuse the Emerging US-China Rivalry. Follow his work at The National Interest.

      <title>3/31/22 Colonel Douglas Macgregor: The US is Deliberately Ignoring the Path to Peace in Ukraine</title>
      <description>On Antiwar Radio this week, Scott interviews Colonel Douglas Macgregor. Macgregor has recently been appearing on talk shows across the political spectrum, drawing on his deep experience as an officer and war planner to argue that Washington must prioritize peace in Eastern Europe. His arguments have drawn criticism from establishment lawmakers and their media allies who instead want to focus on hurting Russia. Macgregor lays out why this is a mistake and what Washington can do instead to bring about a quick end to this war. He also gives his account of where the war stands today. He argues that, despite what western media says, Ukraine has suffered a near-total defeat.  
Discussed on the show:

“Is There A Path To Peace In Ukraine?” (The American Conservative)

“Inside the Pentagon’s Fight Over Russia” (Politico)

Douglas Macgregor, Col. (ret.) is a senior fellow with The American Conservative, the former advisor to the Secretary of Defense in the Trump administration, a decorated combat veteran, and the author of five books.

      <title>3/24/22 Dave Decamp on Russia’s War in Ukraine and Washington’s Reaction</title>
      <description>Dave DeCamp joined Scott on Antiwar Radio yesterday to discuss the Russian war in Ukraine. DeCamp gives a brief rundown of the Russian campaign so far and details where the bulk of the fighting is happening now, as the war enters its second month. Scott and DeCamp then dissect the reaction in Washington, where the Biden Administration is clearly prioritizing the arming of an insurgency over any sort of negotiations. But despite Biden’s foot-dragging, talks between Russia and Ukraine have been taking place. DeCamp fills us in on Russia’s demands and how Ukraine is reacting.

      <title>3/15/22 Kevin Gosztola on the Dangers Posed by the Prosecution of Assange</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-15-22-kevin-gosztola-on-the-dangers-posed-by-the-prosecution-of-assange/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with journalist Kevin Gosztola about the most recent developments in the attempt to extradite Jullian Assange to the United States. Gosztola gives a background of the legal process so far. They then discuss just how blatantly political the effort to punish Assange is. There is no legal distinction between Wikileaks and the other publications that reported on these various leaks. But Assange is an outsider who has regularly and effectively embarrassed the U.S. government. And he is paying a severe and disproportionate price for that. At the end, Gosztola lays out why he predicts so-called “rival” governments like Russia and China to soon begin using Assange’s case to justify imprisoning Western Journalists.  

Discussed on the show:

“UK Supreme Court Slams Door On Assange Appeal, Extradition May Be Authorized” (The Dissenter)

Kevin Gosztola is the managing editor of Shadowproof. He also produces and co-hosts the weekly podcast, “Unauthorized Disclosure.” Follow him on Twitter @kgosztola.

      <title>3/11/22 Larry Bowen and Joe Meadors Tell Their Story of Surviving the Attack on the USS Liberty</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-11-22-larry-bowen-and-joe-meadors-tell-their-story-of-surviving-the-attack-on-the-uss-liberty/</link>
      <description>Scott sat down with two of the survivors of the 1967 Israeli attack on the American Navy ship the USS Liberty. They detail their personal experience and fit their story into the broader historical context of the attack. Although the events of that day, almost 55 years ago, still haunt them, they are both fighting to make the public aware of what happened and to pressure Congress to properly acknowledge the attack. They are doing this despite official threats that talking about the attack would lead to prosecution and jail time. At the end, they explain how you can join them in this fight.

 	Assault on the Liberty by James Ennes

Larry Bowers is a survivor of the USS Liberty attack where he was stationed by the NSA. He now serves as the President of the USS Liberty Veterans Association where he works to raise public awareness of the attack

Joe Meadors is a Navy veteran who served as a Signalman on the USS Liberty during the Israeli attack. Today he works as an activist for his shipmates who perished and those who survived and who, like him, have been silenced for 55 years.

      <title>3/8/22 Max Blumenthal on the Neo-Nazis in Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-8-22-max-blumenthal-on-the-neo-nazi-elements-in-ukraine/</link>
      <description>Max Blumenthal joined Scott on Antiwar Radio to discuss the Neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine that have been enjoying the support of Western governments for years. He also talks about Zelinsky, who was elected on a pro-peace platform which went out the window as soon as he was in power. Instead, he rolled over for the Neo-Nazi group leaders and even floated the idea of bringing nuclear weapons back to Ukraine.

Discussed on the show:

 	“How Ukraine’s Jewish president Zelensky made peace with neo-Nazi paramilitaries on front lines of war with Russia” (The Grayzone)

Director and writer of “Killing Gaza,” Max Blumenthal is a senior editor of the Grayzone Project and the author Goliath, Republican Gomorrah and The 51 Day War. Follow him on Twitter @MaxBlumenthal.

      <title>3/4/22 Peter Van Buren on the War in Ukraine and the Origins of Russiagate</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/3-4-22-peter-van-buren-on-the-war-in-ukraine-and-the-origins-of-russiagate/</link>
      <description>Scott was joined by Peter Van Buren for an extended Antiwar Radio interview. They begin with a long discussion of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, how it’s going and how it will likely end.

      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/2-24-22-hassan-el-tayyab-on-the-effort-to-end-the-war-in-yemen/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Hassan El-Tayyab of the Friends Committee on National Legislation to discuss Yemen. Despite the rapidly unfolding situation in Ukraine, Scott and El-Tayyab agree that what’s happening in Yemen is still the worst humanitarian crisis taking place in the world. And the war can only carry on with the continued support of the U.S. Government. El-Tayyab details how some Americans are working to get their government to stop supporting the Saudi’s immoral war of aggression.  

Discussed on the show:

 	“Lawmakers take action on Biden’s failed Yemen policy” (Responsible Statecraft)
 	1-833-STOPWAR

Hassan El-Tayyab is a musician and peace activist, who works as the lead lobbyist on Middle East policy for the Friends Committee on National Legislation.

      <title>2/18/22 Anne Williamson on How the US Sabotaged Russia’s Economy after the Fall of the Soviet Union</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/2-18-22-anne-williamson-on-how-the-us-sabotaged-russias-economy-after-the-fall-of-the-soviet-union/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews former reporter Anne Williamson about the flawed privatization of Russia after the fall of the USSR. While privatization had mixed success across the former Soviet Bloc, Russia ran into problems immediately with a poor definition of property rights. Williamson explains how this was not a mistake but was designed by American economists and businessmen who wanted to hold Russia down while enriching themselves. Williamson connects the dots to show how those policies led, in part, to the rise of Putin and the tension between the West and Russia today. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Testimony of Anne Williamson” (ScottHorton.org)
 	“Russia: Don't Cry for Yukos” (Mises Institute)

Anne Williamson is a former reporter who covered Russia for the Wall Street Journal and New York Times during the 1990s.

      <title>2/18/22 Ben Freeman on the Army of Ukraine Lobbyists in DC</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/2-18-22-ben-freeman-on-the-army-of-ukraine-lobbyists-in-dc/</link>
      <description>Ben Freeman joined Scott on Antiwar Radio yesterday to discuss some analysis he recently published that looks at the Ukrainian Government’s lobbying efforts in Washington DC. Freeman combed over records and uncovered over 13,000 political activities that Ukraine reported carrying out in the U.S. during 2021. Among those activities were 2,000 contacts with American media and over 8,000 contacts with Congress. Freeman points out that, although he studies how foreign governments work to influence American politics, this effort by Ukraine is on a whole other level. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Army of Ukraine lobbyists behind unprecedented Washington blitz” (Responsible Statecraft)
 	Support KPFK

Ben Freeman is director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative with the Center for International Policy. Read his work at AntiWar.com and follow him on Twitter @BenFreemanDC.

      <title>2/18/22 Doug Bandow on Yemen and Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/2-18-22-doug-bandow-on-yemen-and-ukraine/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Doug Bandow about the escalation of the war in Yemen and the tension with Russia over Ukraine. Bandow explains why the Hawk’s characterization of Iran’s involvement in Yemen is deceptive. They also discuss how it’s in the interest of every faction with decision-making power to keep the war going. Towards the end, they turn to the situation in eastern Europe. Bandow points to a number of topics that often get left out of discussions on this issue— such as the misdeeds of Ukrainian Nationalists and NATO’s history of pushing Russia around— that help to paint a more realistic picture of what is happening. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Biden Administration Goes All in for Saudis and Emiratis” (Antiwar.com)
 	Dave Smith explaining the Yemen War to Joe Rogan

Doug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and a regular contributor at Forbes Magazine, the National Interest, and elsewhere. He’s on Twitter @Doug_Bandow.

      <title>2/18/22 Jack Matlock on the Predictable and Avoidable Crisis Over Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/2-18-22-jack-matlock-on-the-predictable-and-avoidable-crisis-over-ukraine/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Jack Matlock, former Ambassador to the USSR, about the current situation in eastern Europe. While he can’t imagine Russia will actually invade Ukraine, Matlock points to the last three decades of unnecessary NATO expansion as the catalyst for today’s tension. Impressively, he went on record and testified all the way back in 1997 that expanding NATO would be a mistake. Scott and Matlock also point to the discrepancy between the hysterical political narrative being amplified by the media and the actual diplomatic progress as a source for rational optimism. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Today’s Crisis Over Ukraine Was Predictable and Avoidable” (Antiwar.com)

Jack Matlock is a career diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union when the Cold War ended. Since retiring from the Foreign Service, he has focused on understanding how the Cold War ended and how the lessons from that experience might be applied to public policy today.

        <![CDATA[Scott interviews Jack Matlock, former Ambassador to the USSR, about the current situation in eastern Europe. While he can’t imagine Russia will actually invade Ukraine, Matlock points to the last three decades of unnecessary NATO expansion as the catalyst for today’s tension. Impressively, he went on record and testified all the way back in 1997 that expanding NATO would be a mistake. Scott and Matlock also point to the discrepancy between the hysterical political narrative being amplified by the media and the actual diplomatic progress as a source for rational optimism. <br>

      <title>2/6/22 Branko Marcetic on the Nazi Insurgency in Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/2-6-22-branko-marcetic-on-the-nazi-insurgency-in-ukraine/</link>
      <description>Scott was joined by Branko Marcetic of Jacobin on Antiwar Radio this Sunday to discuss the Nazi insurgents in Ukraine that the U.S. appears to be supporting. That term is has been overused in contemporary politics, but Marcetic clarifies that these fighters are indeed literal Nazis. Marcetic fills us in on what is known, what is speculation and how this complicates the simple narrative Americans are being fed about Ukraine’s situation.

      <description>Scott is joined by Dan McKnight of Bring Our Troops Home to discuss the prospects for Defend The Guard legislation in 2022. The legislation seeks to recognize the proper use of the National Guard as laid out in the Constitution by allowing States to block the deployment of their National Guard forces to foreign combat operations unless Congress declares war. McKnight gives an update on the effort and discusses the Ten Seven Club, a new way for combat veterans and concerned citizens to join the push to get these bills passed.

      <title>1/27/22 Gilbert Doctorow on the War Hysteria in Eastern Europe and Germany’s Reluctance to Go Along With It</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-27-22-gilbert-doctorow-on-the-manufactured-war-hysteria-in-eastern-europe-and-germanys-reluctance-to-go-along-with-it/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews political analyst Gilbert Doctorow about the tensions in Eastern Europe. Doctorow points to the strong state of the Russian economy as sufficient evidence that they won’t want to start a new conflict, much less a massive land war. They also discuss the frustrations some Europeans are expressing with all the war hype, which is hurting parts of the European economy.   

Discussed on the show:

 	“The pro-detente position of Willy Brandt’s ‘Ostpolitik” still is alive and finding its voice in Germany today” (GilbertDoctorow.com)

Gilbert Doctorow is an independent political analyst and was the European Coordinator of The American Committee for East-West Accord. He writes regularly for Consortium News. His latest book is Does the United States Have a Future?

      <description>Darren Beattie of Revolver News returns to the show. Beattie’s journalism has raised questions about the inconsistency of the Government’s investigation and prosecution of people who helped breach the Capitol last year. Since he was last on the show, these questions have really begun to make their mark on the national conversation. Beattie and Scott discuss recent developments including Stewart Rhodes’ indictment. And Beattie responds to some of the critiques Buzzfeed’s Ken Bensinger had of Beattie’s work on a recent episode of the Scott Horton Show. 

Discussed on the show:

 	Scott’s interview with Ken Bensinger
 	“Meet Ray Epps” (Revolver)
 	“Meet Ray Epps, Part 2” (Revolver)

      <title>1/21/22 Annelle Sheline on Why Yemen Matters</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-21-22-annelle-sheline-on-why-yemen-matters/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Annelle Sheline of the Quincy Institute to discuss Yemen. Sheline wrote an article recently about the shifting balance of the war. One year after Biden announced an end to U.S. support for offensive Saudi operations, the bombing campaign remains as brutal as ever. Sheline argues that, while all sides have committed atrocities, the scale of the Saudi coalition’s brutality has outshone all others. Further, the war can only happen with continued U.S. support, which puts it on Americans themselves to stop this tragedy.  

Discussed on the show:

 	“Did Biden help the Saudis turn the tide in their favor in Yemen?” (Responsible Statecraft)
 	“In Strategic Shift, U.S. Draws Closer to Yemeni Rebels” (Wall Street Journal) 

Annelle Sheline is a Research Fellow in the Middle East program at the Quincy Institute and an expert on religious and political authority in the Middle East and North Africa. Follow her on Twitter @AnnelleSheline.

      <title>1/21/22 Richard Hanania on American Power, Public Choice Theory and the Rise of China</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-21-22-richard-hanania-on-american-power-public-choice-theory-and-the-rise-of-china/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Richard Hanania of Defense Priorities. They discuss the reality of how the American military’s presence impacts global events. Hanania argues that, if it were true that the U.S. was out there defending its allies, you’d expect those countries to want U.S. troops present more than the U.S. wants to have troops stationed there. But in reality, we often find the opposite. Hanania also gives the reasons he thinks China is all but certain to become the dominant power in East Asia but that right-wing fears over a global Chinese takeover are overblown. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Phantom Empire” (Defense Priorities)
 	“The Inevitable Rise Of China” (Defense Priorities)
 	“Nord Stream II Sanctions Are Not About Security” (The American Conservative)
 	Public Choice Theory and the Illusion of Grand Strategy by Richard Hanania
 	“China has been a failure at hegemony, so let’s just chill” (Responsible Statecraft)

Richard Hanania is a research fellow at Defense Priorities and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. His work focuses on political psychology, the causes of civil war, and the effects of interest groups on U.S. foreign policy. Follow him on Twitter @RichardHanania

      <title>1/20/22 Clint Ehrlich on Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-20-22-clint-ehrlich-on-russia-ukraine-and-kazakhstan/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Clint Ehrlich who recently went viral after his appearance on Tucker Carlson’s show struck the nerve of a handful of foreign policy “experts.” So Scott invited him on the show to dive deeper into his arguments. They discuss why Ehrlich is nervous about the situation in Eastern Europe and how it came to this. He also gives his take on what happened in Kazakhstan.

Discussed on the show:

 	“A Stark Nuclear Warning” (New York Review of Books)
 	“The US Must Prepare for War Against Russia Over Ukraine” (Defense One)

Clint Ehrlich is a foreign-policy analyst, lawyer and former visiting researcher at MGIMO University. Follow him on Twitter @ClintEhrlich.

      <title>1/19/22 Zaher Wahab: Afghanistan is Starving and Nobody Cares</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-19-22-zaher-wahab-afghanistan-is-starving-and-nobody-cares/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Zaher Wahab of the Lewis &amp; Clark Graduate School of Education about the economic catastrophe taking place in Afghanistan. Although the U.S. Government claimed it was working to develop Afghanistan, Wahab explains that what it really did was prop the country’s economy up until it left. Now, in the midst of the collapse, the people of Afghanistan are starving. And the American hawks and pundits, who only four months ago were screaming about the wellbeing of Afghan civilians, now don’t seem to have a care in the world for them. Wahab fills us in on this situation, its causes and what needs to change. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“The Afghanistan Papers” (Washington Post)

Zaher Wahab is a Professor Emeritus at Lewis &amp; Clark Graduate School of Education. He was a senior advisor to the education ministry in Afghanistan from 2002 to 2006. He then taught at the American University of Afghanistan until 2019.

      <title>1/14/22 Ken Bensinger on the Whitmer Kidnapping Plot and January 6th</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-14-22-ken-bensinger-on-the-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-and-january-6th/</link>
      <description>Ken Bensinger of Buzzfeed News returns to the show to follow up about the 2020 plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Although the plot made national headlines when 14 militia members were arrested, Bensinger and fellow journalists dug deeper to find a large presence of FBI agents and informants involved than had gone reported. Further, some informants had apparently played a role in instigating the entire scheme. Bensinger explains the details and developments in that case, and he gives his thoughts and observations about the riot at the National Capitol on January 6th.

Discussed on the show:

 	The Terror Factory by Trevor Aaronson
 	Ken Bensinger’s latest reporting on both cases

Ken Bensinger is an investigative reporter for BuzzFeed News and the author of Red Card: How the U.S. Blew the Whistle on the World’s Biggest Sports Scandal. Follow him on Twitter @kenbensinger.

      <title>1/14/22 Ray McGovern on the US-Russia Talks</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-14-22-ray-mcgovern-on-the-us-russia-talks/</link>
      <description>Ray McGovern is back to discuss the recent talks between Putin and the Biden Administration. McGovern observes that the talks, framed as a tense battle over Ukrainian sovereignty, appear to have actually steered towards a discussion about arms control in the region. A discussion that’s grown in necessity since the Trump Administration abruptly left a nuclear treaty with Russia. Scott and McGovern also talk about the collapsing narrative that the Russians are set to invade Ukraine any day now. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Peeking Past the Pall Put Over Arms Talks With Russia” (Antiwar.com)

Ray McGovern is the co-creator of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity and the former chief of the CIA’s Soviet analysts division. Read all of his work at his website: raymcgovern.com.

      <title>1/13/22 Daniel Ellsberg: Humans Are Not to Be Entrusted With Nuclear Weapons</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-13-22-daniel-ellsberg-humans-are-not-to-be-entrusted-with-nuclear-weapons/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by the heroic whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg to talk about a recent press release he helped put out calling for the abolition of land-based nuclear missiles in the United States. Before getting to that, Scott and Ellsberg discuss how his Pentagon Papers leak contributed to the end of the Vietnam War. Ellsberg then draws on his experience as a nuclear war planner to explain the crazy and perilous thinking behind post-WWII nuclear deterrence plans. They also discuss his most recent leak of classified documents that show how close the U.S. came to starting a nuclear war over Taiwan in the late 1950s. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Organizations Call for Elimination of ‘Launch on Warning’ Land-Based Nuclear Missiles in the United States” (Common Deams)
 	Uncommon Cause - Volume II by General George Lee Butler
 	“Risk of Nuclear War Over Taiwan in 1958 Said to Be Greater Than Publicly Known” (New York Times)
 	“The Drone Papers” (The Intercept)
 	The Spoils of War by Andrew Cockburn

Daniel Ellsberg is a former Marine Corps company commander and nuclear expert for the Rand Corporation. He is the leaker behind the Pentagon Papers, which revealed the truth behind the Vietnam War. He is the author of Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers and The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner.

      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/1-13-22-trita-parsi-on-the-american-publics-influence-on-us-foreign-policy/</link>
      <description>Trita Parsi of the Quincy Institute recently wrote a piece in a German publication arguing that the noninterventionist sentiment of the Trump years was not an arbitration.

Next, they discuss how global perceptions of Biden’s political situation are affecting the Iran deal negotiations. Lastly, they touch on the continuing war in Yemen. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“The end of American adventurism abroad” (IPS)
 	Doomsday by Daniel Ellsberg 
 	“Biden’s Shameful Silence on Saudi Arabia’s War in Yemen” (The New Republic) 
 	“In Strategic Shift, U.S. Draws Closer to Yemeni Rebels” (Wall Street Journal)

      <description>Scott is joined by Bill Ottman, the co-founder and CEO of Minds — a blockchain-based social network.

And although some alternatives have been gaining in popularity, nothing has taken off as the new place as of yet. Ottman and Scott discuss the landscape of alternative social networks, the features these networks are offering and what we can expect as the internet continues to evolve. 

Discussed on the show:

 	Dr. Robert Malone on the Joe Rogan Experience

Bill Ottman is an Internet entrepreneur and freedom of information activist based in Connecticut. He is also the CEO and co-founder of Minds.

      <title>12/30/21 Grant F. Smith on Israel’s Evolving Strategy to Sway American Politics</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-30-21-grant-f-smith-on-israels-evolving-strategy-to-sway-american-politics/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Grant F. Smith to talk about the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s (AIPAC) new strategy for reaching U.S. politicians. AIPAC has largely operated as a lobbying group on behalf of the State of Israel. But, as Smith explains, they are now working to set up a network of Political Action Committees. This will give them more freedom to fund candidates they like, and support the opponents of candidates they don’t. Scott and Smith give possible reasons for the evolving methods. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“AIPAC forming political action committees to tighten grip on U.S. elections” (Washington Report on Middle Eastern Affairs)
 	“Joe Biden should end the US pretence over Israel’s ‘secret’ nuclear weapons” (The Guardian)

Grant F. Smith is the author of a number of books including Big Israel: How Israel’s Lobby Moves America, Divert!, and most recently The Israel Lobby Enters State Government: Rise of the Virginia Israel Advisory Board. He is director of the Institute for Research: Middle Eastern Policy in Washington, D.C.

      <title>12/30/21 Darren Beattie on the Mysterious Men Who Breached the Capitol</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-30-21-darren-beattie-on-the-mysterious-men-who-breached-the-capitol/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Darren J. Beattie of Revolver News about the in-depth articles he’s written about the riot at the Capitol last January. Beattie’s reporting uses video and photo evidence to highlight a number of individuals who were instrumental in breaching the Capitol grounds and in directing rally-goers towards the building. But while hundreds of attendees have been charged for their actions that day, this group of instigators has remained virtually untouched by federal investigators. Scott and Beattie discuss possible explanations and look at the broader context beyond the riot. 

Discussed on the show:

 	Tucker Carlson’s Patriot Purge (IMDb)
 	“Meet Ray Epps” (Revolver)
 	“Meet Ray Epps, Part 2” (Revolver)
 	The Secret Life of Bill Clinton by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard
 	The Terror Factory by Trevor Aaronson

      <title>12/30/21 Basir Bita on the Economic Crisis in Afghanistan</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-30-21-basir-bita-on-the-economic-crisis-in-afghanistan/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews activist Basir Bita about the economic calamity that’s hit Afghanistan since the U.S. withdrawal this past summer. With the U.S. and IMF freezing Afghan government funds as well as widespread market corrections after the fall of the previous regime, Afghanistan has been thrown into turmoil. Food prices have tripled since the summer and many Afghans face issues with food security. Bita argues that the Biden Administration and others should get over their hesitation to work with the new government of Afghanistan. And that a refusal to do so reveals how little they truly care for the Afghan people, despite their rhetoric. 

Basir Bita is a civil society activist now based out of Canada. He is an advisor for Afghan Peace Volunteers, a youth group in Kabul, Afghanistan that advocates for nonviolent conflict resolution. Follow him on Twitter @BasirBita

      <title>12/30/21 Daniel Larison: US Militarism Should Have Died With the Soviet Union</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-30-21-daniel-larison-us-militarism-should-have-died-with-the-soviet-union/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Antiwar.com contributing editor Daniel Larison to discuss his most recent piece. Larison argues that the period following the peaceful breakup of the USSR was the best moment for the U.S. to shed the militaristic blob it had built up in the name of fighting communism. Instead, the military-industrial-congressional complex scrambled to find a new enemy. And the next thirty years of meddling in the Middle East and Eastern Europe have resulted in today’s messy geopolitical status quo. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“US Militarism Should Have Died With the Soviet Union” (Antiwar.com)
 	“The Looming Threat of a Nuclear Crisis with Iran” (The New Yorker)

Daniel Larison is a contributing editor at Antiwar.com, contributor at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and former senior editor at The American Conservative magazine. Follow him on Twitter @DanielLarison or on his blog, Eunomia.

      <title>12/22/21 Gareth Porter on Iran and Afghanistan</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-22-21-gareth-porter-on-iran-and-afghanistan/</link>
      <description>Scott celebrates eleven years on the radio by interviewing Gareth Porter about Biden’s first year in office. They discuss the negotiations between the Administration and Iran over a return to the JCPOA. Despite many crossovers with the team that reached an agreement with Iran back in the Obama years, Biden’s people appear set on squeezing more concessions out of the Iranians. But Porter points out that, as he had predicted, the U.S. reluctance to return to the deal led to hardliner victories in Iran’s last elections. But even with a more anti-American regime, Porter sees no evidence they’d actually produce a nuclear bomb. Scott and Porter also talk about Afghanistan and the humanitarian crisis the so-called champions of Afghan freedom seem completely uninterested in helping to relieve.

Discussed on the show:

 	“When the Ayatollah Said No to Nukes” (Foreign Policy)
 	“The Civilian Casualty Files” (New York Times) 

Gareth Porter is an investigative historian and journalist on the national security state. He is the author of Manufactured Crisis: The Untold Story of the Iran Nuclear Scare and, with John Kiriakou, The CIA Insider’s Guide to the Iran Crisis. Follow him on Twitter @GarethPorter and listen to Gareth’s previous appearances on the Scott Horton Show.

But Porter points out that, as he had predicted, the U.S. reluctance to return to the deal led to hardliner victories in Iran’s last elections. But even with a more anti-American regime, Porter sees no evidence they’d actually produce a nuclear bomb. Scott and Porter also talk about Afghanistan and the humanitarian crisis the so-called champions of Afghan freedom seem completely uninterested in helping to relieve.<br>

      <title>12/10/21 Kevin Gosztola on Assange’s Future After the High Court Ruling</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-10-21-kevin-gosztola-on-assanges-future-after-the-high-court-ruling/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by journalist Kevin Gosztola to discuss the evolving situation Julian Assange finds himself in. The UK’s High Court recently overturned a decision blocking Assange from extradition to the United States. This plunges the case into further rounds of litigation. Gosztola explains these next steps and discusses what is needed for Assange to walk free. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Assange Plans to Appeal High Court Decision Backing Extradition to the United States” (Shadowproof)
 	“Inside the CIA's secret war plans against WikiLeaks” (Yahoo! News)

Kevin Gosztola is managing editor of Shadowproof. He also produces and co-hosts the weekly podcast, “Unauthorized Disclosure.” Follow him on Twitter @kgosztola.

      <title>12/3/21 Giorgio Cafiero on the Rumors of Russian Mercenaries Fighting in Mali</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-3-21-giorgio-cafiero-on-the-rumors-of-russian-mercenaries-fighting-in-mali/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Giorgio Cafiero about an article he wrote last month on France’s war in Mali. Cafiero gives a concise, but thorough, background on the war, how it started and where it stands today. He then explains how anti-French sentiment in the country has been on the rise. In that context, rumors have been making the rounds about a deal between the Mali government and a top Russian mercenary group. Scott and Cafiero discuss what this could mean for the region, and the world, if these rumors are true.

Discussed on the show:

 	“Mali could rewrite Russian-French relations in the Sahel” (TRT World)

Giorgio Cafiero is the CEO and founder of Gulf State Analytics, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Washington, DC. He writes regularly for the Middle East Institute, The National Interest, and LobeLog. Find him on Twitter @GiorgioCafiero.

      <title>12/3/21 Bob Murphy and Jon Schwarz on Whether Current Inflation Is a Good Thing</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-3-21-bob-murphy-and-jon-schwarz-on-whether-current-inflation-is-a-good-thing/</link>
      <description>Jon Schwarz wrote an article for the Intercept last month that stirred up quite a buzz. In the piece, Schwarz makes the argument that, because it’s hurting creditors and shrinking the real value of debt, inflation should be viewed as good news for most people. Scott brought Schwarz on together with Austrian economist Bob Murphey to have a discussion about Schwarz’s argument and monetary policy more broadly.  

Discussed on the show:

 	“Inflation Is Good for You” (The Intercept)
 	Understanding Money Mechanics by Bob Murphy
 	Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country by William Greider

Jon Schwarz is a writer for The Intercept, and has written for the New Yorker, the New York Times, The Atlantic, the Wall Street Journal, “Saturday Night Live,” and many others. Find him on his blog, A Tiny Revolution, or on Twitter @schwarz.

Bob Murphy is an economist with the Institute for Energy Research, a research fellow with the Independent Institute, and a senior fellow at the Ludwig von Mises Institute. He is the author of The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism and Choice: Cooperation, Enterprise, and Human Action. Find him on Twitter @BobMurphyEcon and listen to his podcast The Bob Murphy Show.

      <title>12/2/21 Gilbert Doctorow on the Growing Tension at the Russia-Ukrainian Border</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-2-21-gilbert-doctorow-on-the-growing-tension-at-the-russia-ukrainian-border/</link>
      <description>Scott was joined by Gilbert Doctorow on Antiwar Radio Sunday to talk about Russia and Ukraine. The recent Russian build-up of forces on its border with Ukraine’s Donbas Region has been highly publicized in American media, but the greater context has been all but eliminated from the public discourse. Doctorow provides that context in this interview. He explains how Russian actions are better understood as reactions to American weapons flowing into Ukraine, something the Kremlin considers to be a de facto NATO expansion. Doctorow also explains the dangerous next steps we can expect if this escalation is allowed to continue. 

Discussed on the show:

 	Nyet Means Nyet Cable (Wikileaks)
 	“Rules of war need rewriting for the age of AI weapons” (Financial Times)
 	“Remember Pearl Harbor, Mr. President?” (The American Conservative)

Gilbert Doctorow is an independent political analyst and was the European Coordinator of The American Committee for East-West Accord. He writes regularly for Consortium News. His latest book is Does the United States Have a Future?

        <![CDATA[Scott was joined by Gilbert Doctorow on Antiwar Radio Sunday to talk about Russia and Ukraine. The recent Russian build-up of forces on its border with Ukraine’s Donbas Region has been highly publicized in American media, but the greater context has been all but eliminated from the public discourse. Doctorow provides that context in this interview. He explains how Russian actions are better understood as reactions to American weapons flowing into Ukraine, something the Kremlin considers to be a de facto NATO expansion. Doctorow also explains the dangerous next steps we can expect if this escalation is allowed to continue. <br>

      <title>12/2/21 Ford Fischer on the New Details Surrounding Johnny Hurley’s Tragic Death</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-2-21-ford-fischer-on-the-new-details-surrounding-johnny-hurleys-tragic-death/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by journalist and primary source documentarian Ford Fischer to discuss the recently released footage of Johnny Hurley’s death at the hands of an Arvada police officer. Fischer made a short documentary about the tragedy shortly after it occurred this past summer. Hurley heroically gunned down a man who had just begun what was clearly an attempted killing spree. By doing so, Hurley likely saved numerous lives, but he was tragically killed moments later when police arrived on the scene. Fischer explains what this recently released surveillance and bodycam footage reveals about Johnny Hurley’s last act. 

Discussed on the show:

 	Fischer’s July Short Documentary about the shooting
 	Full Footage of the Shooting (Graphic)

      <title>12/2/21 Patricia Hynes Explains How the US Military Poisoned Its Own Soldiers</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/12-2-21-patricia-hynes-explains-how-the-us-military-poisoned-its-own-soldiers/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Patricia Hynes about a piece she wrote back in 2017 highlighting the devastation caused by burn pits on American military bases over the last thirty years. Scott wanted to discuss this now because the Federal Government has finally started looking for ways to help the veterans exposed to these toxic fumes. They also lay out why Biden likely feels he has a personal stake in this effort. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“The Burn Pits” (Truthdig)
 	“Burn Pits: Federal Government Finally Helping Vets Suffering from Military Pollution” (Institute for Public Accuracy)
 	The Burn Pits: The Poisoning of America's Soldiers by Joseph Hickman

Patricia (Pat) Hynes is a retired environmental engineer and professor of environmental health.  She is currently publishing and speaking on the health effects of war and militarism on society and on women in particular; climate justice; renewable energy; and the hazards of nuclear power. She directs the Traprock Center for Peace and Justice in western Massachusetts

      <description>Scott is joined by John Dolan who used to write under the names Gary Brecher and The War Nerd.

      <title>11/30/21 Hassan El-Tayyab on This Weeks Senate Vote to Block the Saudi Arms Sale</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-30-21-hassan-el-tayyab-on-this-weeks-senate-vote-to-block-the-saudi-arms-sale/</link>
      <description>Hassan El-Tayyab is back with an update on a Senate vote taking place later this week that aims to block the Biden Administrations' $600 million arms sale to Saudi Arabia. The resolution is the result of Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee teaming up with Bernie Sanders. And so, with both parties already being represented, it’s the perfect time to attack the Left from the left and the Right from the right. El-Tayyab has already seen members of Congress react positively to pressure from their constituents on this issue. Follow the links below to reach out to your Senator and tell them to vote yes on S.J.Res.31.

Hassan El-Tayyab is a musician and peace activist, who works as the lead lobbyist on Middle East policy for the Friends Committee on National Legislation.

      <title>11/24/21 Aaron Maté on the Award-Winning Lies Still Propping up Russiagate</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-24-21-aaron-mate-on-the-award-winning-lies-still-propping-up-russiagate/</link>
      <description>On Antiwar Radio this Sunday, Scott was joined by Aaron Maté to discuss an article he wrote for Real Clear Investigations. Amidst the collapse of the Steele dossier, Maté wrote about five articles that either won the Pulitzer prize or were written by journalists who had won a Pulitzer, all of which were about disproven aspects of Russiagate unrelated to Christopher Steele. They discuss the framing of Michael Flynn, the fictional calls between Trump officials and Russian intelligence, the conflation of bots posting memes with the bombing of Pearl Harbor and more. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Five Trump-Russia 'Collusion' Corrections We Need From the Media Now -- Just for Starters” (Real Clear Investigations)

Amidst the collapse of the Steele dossier, Maté wrote about five articles that either won the Pulitzer prize or were written by journalists who had won a Pulitzer, all of which were about disproven aspects of Russiagate unrelated to Christopher Steele. They discuss the framing of Michael Flynn, the fictional calls between Trump officials and Russian intelligence, the conflation of bots posting memes with the bombing of Pearl Harbor and more. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Five Trump-Russia 'Collusion' Corrections We Need From the Media Now -- Just for Starters” (Real Clear Investigations)

      <title>11/19/21 Peter Van Buren on Why China’s Not Invading Taiwan and How Absurd the Russiagate Story Was From the Beginning</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-19-21-peter-van-buren-on-why-chinas-not-invading-taiwan-and-how-absurd-the-russiagate-story-was-from-the-beginning/</link>
      <description>On Antiwar Radio this past Sunday, Scott interviewed Peter Van Buren about two articles he wrote on Taiwan. Van Buren laid out the reasons he believes a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is unlikely. Scott’s slot of airtime only runs 30 minutes. But they ended up talking for an additional hour about the absurdity of Russiagate. The entire interview is presented here in full. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Taiwan Is Not About China” (The American Conservative)
 	“Taiwan Means War Only If We Want It To” (The American Conservative)
 	“Durham Indicts Danchenko” (The American Conservative)
 	Fear by Bob Woodward
 	The Manchurian Candidate IMDb
 	“The US makes the rules, and Syria massacre was no exception” (Responsible Statecraft)

Peter Van Buren worked for 24 years at the Department of State including a year in Iraq. He is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People and the novel Hooper’s War. He is now a contributing editor at The American Conservative magazine.

      <title>11/15/21 Lyle J. Goldstein on How the US Would Lose the Battle for Taiwan</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-15-21-lyle-j-goldstein-on-how-the-us-would-lose-the-battle-for-taiwan/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Lyle J. Goldstein, who now works at Defense Priorities. Goldstein challenges the idea that a war with China over Taiwan would be fundamentally different from the war in Afghanistan. In fact, he thinks the U.S. had a better chance of victory in Afghanistan. He explains how China could render all U.S. carrier groups useless and force the Americans to rely completely on their submarines. But neither would that be a path to victory because of China’s anti-submarine capabilities. Goldstein also points out that it’s by trying to destroy these Chinese ship-killing missile launch sites that the stage is set for dangerous escalation.

Discussed on the show:

 	“Like Afghanistan, a War for Taiwan is Unwinnable” (National Interest)
 	“The Scary War Game Over Taiwan That the U.S. Loses Again and Again” (Real Clear Investigations)
 	“The War Nerd: This is how the Carriers Will DIe” (The Exiled)

Lyle J. Goldstein is the Director of Asia Engagement at Defense Priorities. He is the author of Meeting China Halfway: How to Defuse the Emerging US-China Rivalry. Follow his work at The National Interest.

      <title>11/12/21 Joe Lauria Explains Julian Assange’s Situation</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-12-21-joe-lauria-explains-julian-assanges-situation/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Joe Lauria of Consortium News. Lauria gives us a detailed account of Assange’s eventful past year. A British judge, who despite agreeing that Assange had violated the Espionage Act by publishing secrets handed to him, refused to extradite him to the U.S. out of concern for his safety. Lauria explains all of this and puts these events in a broader context.  

Discussed on the show:

 	“What’s next for Julian Assange?” (NewAge)

Joe Lauria is the editor-in-chief at Consortium News. He is a former UN correspondent and wrote at the Boston Globe and Wall Street Journal. You can follow him on Twitter @unjoe.

      <title>11/12/21 Aaron Maté on the Further Collapse of Russiagate</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-12-21-aaron-mate-on-the-further-collapse-of-russiagate/</link>
      <description>Aaron Maté is back to give an update on Russiagate as the years-long conspiracy theory continues to fall completely apart. Maté fills us in on the indictment of Igor Danchenko, who was a major source for the Steele Dossier. Danchenko’s claims were just about all fiction. However, he made the mistake of lying to the FBI about some of the more embarrassing ways information made its way into the dossier. Scott and Maté talk about the details of what happened and observe how the conspiracy theorists in the corporate media are handling the news. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Russiagate has no rock bottom” (Maté’s Substack)
 	Fear by Bob Woodward
 	Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes

      <title>11/12/21 Hassan El-Tayyab on the Many Ways Congress Can End the War in Yemen</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-12-21-hassan-el-tayyab-on-the-many-ways-congress-can-end-the-war-in-yemen/</link>
      <description>This last Sunday, Hassan El-Tayyab of the Friends Committee On National Legislation joined Antiwar Radio to talk with Scott about Yemen. El-Tayyab explains the numerous ways Congress could end the War in Yemen. He also points out that there are a solid number of Senators and Representatives who have demonstrated some degree of disapproval for our involvement in the war. Both Scott and El-Tayyab agree that real results could be close, and urge listeners to get involved and help push this antiwar effort over the finish line. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Iran’s Small Hand in Yemen” (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace)
 	“US maintains intelligence relationship with Houthis” (Al-Monitor)
 	Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation
 	Quincy Institute 

Hassan El-Tayyab is a musician and peace activist, who works as the lead lobbyist on Middle East policy for the Friends Committee on National Legislation.

      <title>11/12/21 Dave DeCamp with Updates on Russia, Iraq, Yemen and Taiwan</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-12-21-dave-decamp-with-updates-on-russia-iraq-yemen-and-taiwan/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Antiwar.com’s Dave DeCamp for a rapid fire review of what’s been happening around the world. They start with Russia where the U.S. has told its European allies an invasion of Ukraine could be imminent. DeCamp explains that, if there’s any truth to the Russian troop movements within Russia, it’s likely a response to NATO military activity in the Black Sea region. Next they discuss Iraq. The Iraqi Prime Minister was apparently the target of a drone attack that plenty of hawks were quickly, and baselessly, blaming on Iran. Then they talk about Yemen, where the war appears to have become a bloody stalemate with neither side likely to give in. Finally they discuss China and how the war drums in Washington are beating for Taiwan.

      <title>11/12/21 Daniel Davis: We Shouldn’t Send American Soldiers to Die for Taiwan</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-12-21-daniel-davis-we-shouldnt-send-american-soldiers-to-die-for-taiwan/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Daniel Davis about an article he recently published at 19fortyfive.com about Taiwan. Davis does believe there is a solid chance that China will invade Taiwan. At the same time, he does not think there is anything the U.S. can actually do about it. Davis explains that, while the American military is much more powerful on a global scale, the Chinese have enough firepower pointed off their coast to overwhelm the U.S. Navy if it gets close to Taiwan. Scott and Davis agree that it would be a costly and ultimately doomed fight. And both stress that the National Security “experts” pointing to nuclear deterrence as the answer are playing a very dangerous and very stupid game.  

Discussed on the show:

 	“Why Should American Soldiers Die For Taiwan?” (1945)
 	“America Needs To Stop Demanding North Korea Give Up Its Nuclear Weapons” (1945)

      <itunes:summary>Scott interviews Daniel Davis about an article he recently published at 19fortyfive.com about Taiwan. Davis does believe there is a solid chance that China will invade Taiwan. At the same time, he does not think there is anything the U.S. can actually do about it. Davis explains that, while the American military is much more powerful on a global scale, the Chinese have enough firepower pointed off their coast to overwhelm the U.S. Navy if it gets close to Taiwan. Scott and Davis agree that it would be a costly and ultimately doomed fight. And both stress that the National Security “experts” pointing to nuclear deterrence as the answer are playing a very dangerous and very stupid game.  

Discussed on the show:

 	“Why Should American Soldiers Die For Taiwan?” (1945)
 	“America Needs To Stop Demanding North Korea Give Up Its Nuclear Weapons” (1945)

      <title>11/12/21 Daniel Larison on Iran, Sanctions and Great Power Competition</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-12-21-daniel-larison-on-iran-sanctions-and-great-power-competition/</link>
      <description>Scott brings Daniel Larison back to the show to discuss a handful of articles he’s written recently for Antiwar.com. First they discuss his piece pointing out that there is no legal basis for any action the U.S. takes against Iran, a fact that ought to be brought up more in our public discourse. Scott and Larison also discuss how American foreign policy itself is a rather large incentive for Iran to become a nuclear power. We’ve killed leaders who gave up their nukes. And those who have them, we tend to just criticize from afar. Next they tackle sanctions. The pain caused by American sanctions is as real as the pain caused by American bombs, but it’s not as easy to visualize. Larison explains what we should picture. Lastly they discuss Great Power Competition and predict what will happen as America’s global military power shrinks. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Attacking Iran Would Be a Crime” (Antiwar.com) 
 	“Sanctions Are an Inherently Indiscriminate Weapon” (Antiwar.com)
 	“Dispensing With Indispensability: The US Failed To Improve the World” (Antiwar.com)
 	“The Bankruptcy of ‘Great Power Competition’” (Antiwar.com)
 	The Stupidity of War by John Mueller

Daniel Larison is a contributing editor at Antiwar.com, contributor at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and former senior editor at The American Conservative magazine. Follow him on Twitter @DanielLarison or on his blog, Eunomia.

      <title>11/12/21 Hunter DeRensis on America’s History of Hating War Profiteers</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-12-21-hunter-derensis-on-americas-history-of-hating-war-profiteers/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Hunter DeRensis to discuss a recent longform article he wrote for The American Conservative. The article was the culmination of months of research DeRensis did on the history of the American public’s perception of weapons manufacturers. DeRensis identifies the period between the World Wars as being the age with the most resistance to the war profiteers. Interestingly, that resistance was largely led by middle-class conservatives. Scott and DeRensis point to Joe Kent, who’s running for Congress in Washington State, as an example of the return of this right-wing resistance to the military-industrial complex.

Discussed on the show:

 	“Merchants Of Death” (The American Conservative) 

Hunter DeRensis is communications director for BringOurTroopsHome.US and a regular contributor to The American Conservative. Find him on his website or on Twitter @HunterDeRensis.

      <title>11/4/21 Peter Zeihan on American Power and China’s Coming Collapse</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/11-4-21-peter-zeihan-on-american-power-and-chinas-coming-collapse/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews author and geopolitical analyst Peter Zeihan. Zeihan does not believe China will be a nation state ten years from now. One reason, he argues, is that China’s economy is completely dependent on the disappearing American presence keeping the peace on the world's oceans. This, of course, leads to a back and forth between him and Scott over just how much America’s presence overseas has been disappearing these last few decades. Zeihan also points to the policies the CCP used to regulate the birthrate, which he explains has led to an insufficient number of childbearing aged people to maintain the Chinese population. On top of that, the economy is built on a pile of debt that puts the country’s economy in jeopardy. Zeihan predicts the CCP will take an ultranationalist turn in response to all of these mounting problems. Something that may make war more likely.

      <title>10/29/21 Ryan McMaken on the Economy, the Money Supply and the Labor Shortage</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-29-21-ryan-mcmaken-on-the-economy-the-money-supply-and-the-labor-shortage/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Ryan McMaken from the Mises Institute to talk about the state of the economy. McMaken describes how we are still living with the consequences of the 2008 financial crisis as well as the response to it. However, while the government created a ton of new money back then, they took steps to avoid flooding the entire economy with those new dollars. But McMaken explains that those steps have been absent during the aggressive money printing that’s occurred since the pandemic began. Something that has likely played a major role in the inflating prices of goods we are seeing now. Lastly, McMaken touches on what’s going on with the national labor shortage and why it’s surprising him.    

Discussed on the show:

 	The Creature from Jekyll Island by G.W. Griffin 
 	Engine of Inequality by Karen Petrou
 	The Case Against 2 Per Cent Inflation by Brendon Brown
 	“Why the Fed's 2 Percent Inflation Standard Is So Bad” (Mises Wire)

Ryan McMaken is a senior editor at the Mises Institute. He has degrees in economics and political science from the University of Colorado, and was the economist for the Colorado Division of Housing from 2009 to 2014. He is the author of Commie Cowboys: The Bourgeoisie and the Nation-State in the Western Genre.

        <![CDATA[Scott is joined by Ryan McMaken from the Mises Institute to talk about the state of the economy. McMaken describes how we are still living with the consequences of the 2008 financial crisis as well as the response to it. However, while the government created a ton of new money back then, they took steps to avoid flooding the entire economy with those new dollars. But McMaken explains that those steps have been absent during the aggressive money printing that’s occurred since the pandemic began. Something that has likely played a major role in the inflating prices of goods we are seeing now. Lastly, McMaken touches on what’s going on with the national labor shortage and why it’s surprising him.    <br>

      <title>10/29/21 Kevin Gosztola on the Cruelty Julian Assange Could Face in America</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-29-21-kevin-gosztola-on-the-cruelty-julian-assange-could-face-in-america/</link>
      <description>Kevin Gosztola is back to give an update on the appeal hearing against Julian Assange. Back in January, a UK judge ruled against Assange’s extradition to the U.S., citing his mental health. The U.S. government appealed that decision, leading to this hearing. Gosztola, who was able to watch, gives Scott an update on what arguments were presented. He then explains the numerous ways that, if he’s extradited, the U.S. could strip Assange of his basic liberties and isolate him from friends and family. After hearing the prosecution’s arguments, both are a bit optimistic about Assange’s chance of again avoiding extradition. But the decision is not expected to be known for weeks.  

Discussed on the show:

 	“Appeal Hearing: Prosecutor Attacks Judge's Decision, Which Blocked US From Extraditing Assange” (The Dissenter) 
 	“Appeal Hearing: CIA's War On Assange, Their 'Most Prominent Critic,' Takes Center Stage” (The Dissenter)
 	“Inside the CIA’s secret war plans against WikiLeaks” (Yahoo News) 

Kevin Gosztola is managing editor of Shadowproof. He also produces and co-hosts the weekly podcast, “Unauthorized Disclosure.” Follow him on Twitter @kgosztola.

      <title>10/26/21 Cheryl Rofer on the Shoddy Science behind Havana Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-26-21-cheryl-rofer-on-the-shoddy-science-behind-havana-syndrome/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by writer and chemist Cheryl Rofer. Rofer penned an article back in May that debunked the increasingly popular theory that numerous American intelligence and diplomatic personnel were in fact the victims of a targeted microwave weapon. Rofer points out that all of the supposed evidence can be explained away. On top of that, the theoretical weapon itself does not even make any sense and can certainly not explain the alleged cases. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Claims of Microwave Attacks Are Scientifically Implausible” (Foreign Policy)

Cheryl Rofer is a writer of scientific and political commentary. She was a chemist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for 35 years.

      <title>10/25/21 Nasser Arrabyee on the Yemen Atrocity and the Battle for Marib</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-25-21-nasser-arrabyee-on-the-yemen-atrocity-and-the-battle-for-marib/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Nasser Arrabyee who gives an update on the state of the war in Yemen. The battle for Marib is raging as the Houthis take control of more and more districts. The city is one of the last strongholds outside of Houthi control, and it looks like that may change soon. Arrabyee also gives an update on the rest of the country, where the Saudi blockade continues to wreak havoc on the population. 

Discussed on the show:

 	Scott’s interview about Marib with Scott Paul

Nasser Arrabyee is a Yemeni journalist based in Sana’a, Yemen. He is the owner and director of yemen-now.com. You can follow him on Twitter @narrabyee.

      <title>10/25/21 Trita Parsi on Biden’s Awful Approach to JCPOA Negotiations</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-25-21-trita-parsi-on-bidens-awful-approach-to-jcpoa-negotiations/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Trita Parsi about Biden's bizarre approach to JCPOA negotiations.  When Biden came into office, the Iranians wanted to work out some mechanism to limit any future President’s ability to pull out of the JCPOA in a similar fashion to Trump. The U.S. said no, so the Iranians said they would settle for a binding commitment for the rest of Biden's first term, but even that was rejected by the Americans. Parsi explains that stability is necessary for sanctions relief to work. He also says Iran’s status as a signatory of the Non-Proliferation Treaty is at risk if the U.S. keeps refusing to move forward. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Revealed: Biden rejected way forward in Iran deal talks” (Responsible Statecraft) 

Trita Parsi is the president of the National Iranian American Council and the author of Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy. Parsi is the recipient of the 2010 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order. Follow him on Twitter @tparsi.

      <title>10/22/21 Gareth Porter on the Self Licking Ice Cream Cone</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-22-21-gareth-porter-on-the-self-licking-ice-cream-cone/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined once again by Gareth Porter to discuss a piece he wrote at the beginning of the month for Responsible Statecraft. But before talking about the article, Porter gives a quick update on the developing situation in Lebanon. The article Porter wrote talks about the “self licking ice cream cone,” a saying used to describe the self-perpetuating nature of the military-industrial-congressional complex. Porter explains how these perverse incentives kept us embroiled in war for two full decades.   

Discussed on the show:

 	“How the ‘self licking ice cream cone,’ prolonged the 20-year war” (Responsible Statecraft)
 	“This Air Force commando called in 688,000 pounds of bombs in one battle” (Task &amp; Purpose)
 	Joe Kent on Fox News

Gareth Porter is an investigative historian and journalist on the national security state. He is the author of Manufactured Crisis: The Untold Story of the Iran Nuclear Scare and, with John Kiriakou, The CIA Insider’s Guide to the Iran Crisis. Follow him on Twitter @GarethPorter and listen to Gareth’s previous appearances on the Scott Horton Show.

      <itunes:summary>Scott is joined once again by Gareth Porter to discuss a piece he wrote at the beginning of the month for Responsible Statecraft. But before talking about the article, Porter gives a quick update on the developing situation in Lebanon. The article Porter wrote talks about the “self licking ice cream cone,” a saying used to describe the self-perpetuating nature of the military-industrial-congressional complex. Porter explains how these perverse incentives kept us embroiled in war for two full decades.   

Discussed on the show:

 	“How the ‘self licking ice cream cone,’ prolonged the 20-year war” (Responsible Statecraft)
 	“This Air Force commando called in 688,000 pounds of bombs in one battle” (Task &amp; Purpose)
 	Joe Kent on Fox News

      <title>10/22/21 William Hartung on the Existential Threat of the Nuclear Weapons Lobby</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-22-21-william-hartung-on-the-existential-threat-of-the-nuclear-weapons-lobby/</link>
      <description>William Hartung returns to the show for a quick episode about a press release he published at the Institute for Public Accuracy. Hartung describes the current setup of America’s ICBMs. The missiles are spread across the country, sitting on hair-trigger alert. It’s a setup that many experts admit is dangerous, and unnecessary. Yet any effort to roll back the program has been blocked by the Senators who’s states benefit the most from the presence of silos, as well as the companies that build them. Hartung explains what’s at stake if the status quo is allowed to continue. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“How the ICBM Lobby is Threatening Armageddon” (Institute for Public Accuracy)
 	“To Avoid Armageddon, Don’t Modernize Missiles—Eliminate Them” (The Nation) 
 	“Inside the ICBM Lobby: Special Interests Or the National Interest?” (Arms Control Association) 

William Hartung is director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, and the author of Prophets of War: Lockheed Martin and the Making of the Military-Industrial Complex. Find him on Twitter @WilliamHartung.

      <title>10/22/21 Aaron Maté on the Clintonian Origins of Russiagate</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-22-21-aaron-mate-on-the-clintonian-origins-of-russiagate/</link>
      <description>Aaron Maté is back on the show to discuss an article he wrote published at Real Clear Investigations. Maté explains how, although the origins of Russiagate are still murky, the Clinton Campaign seems to be at the center of it all. Notably with Clinton lawyers hiring Fusion GPS to look into Trump connections with Russia, an “inquiry” that led to the Steele Dossier. The Campaign’s legal team also hired Crowdstrike to investigate the DNC email leak, a step that was necessary to push the narrative that the leak was carried out by the Russians to support Trump. Maté stresses the timeline for which these events took place, because the dates alone are fatal to the establishment’s narrative.  

Discussed on the show:

 	“Coming Into Focus: Hillary's Secretive, Russiagate-Flogging Pair of Super-Lawyers” (Real Clear Investigations)
 	Scott’s Interview with Craig Murray 
 	“CrowdStrikeOut: Mueller’s Own Report Undercuts Its Core Russia-Meddling Claims” (Real Clear Investigations)
 	Scott’s debate with Bill Kristol
 	“Claims of Microwave Attacks Are Scientifically Implausible” (Foreign Policy)

      <title>10/18/21 Scott Hechinger on the Murder Rate, Police Reform and Gun Control</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-18-21-scott-hechinger-on-the-murder-rate-police-reform-and-gun-control/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews attorney Scott Hechinger about a recent article he wrote for The Nation. They discuss the recent jump in the murder rate, its possible causes and the portrayal of the increase in the media. Hechinger explains that the universal nature of the increase hurts the argument that bail and police reform are causing crime surges. Scott and Hechinger also discuss racial disparities in the justice system. Both agree that the problem is in the over-policing of poor black communities rather than the lack of policing in affluent white neighborhoods. Lastly, they touch on the closing of Wallgreens in San Fransisco and the problems with the further criminalization of gun possession.

Discussed on the show:

 	“A Massive Fail on Crime Reporting by The New York Times, NPR” (The Nation) 

Scott Hechinger is a civil rights attorney and the executive director of Zealous, a national coalition supporting local initiatives to harness media and storytelling for justice. Follow him on Twitter @ScottHech

      <title>10/14/21 James Bradley on the Lies Americans Are Fed About China</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-14-21-james-bradley-on-the-lies-americans-are-fed-about-china/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by author James Bradley. They discuss how foolish the Russiagate story was from the beginning before getting into China. Bradley explains how the entire American understanding of China is flawed. That the average American’s perception of China is the result of a mirage or fictional narrative we’ve been fed for many decades. Bradley argues that no rational look at China makes them out to be the threat they’re portrayed to be. And that, instead, the greatest threat comes from the American aggression that results from these false stories. 

Discussed on the show:

 	Scott’s interview with Jeffery Carr - July 2016
 	“Konstantin Kilimnik, Russiagate's Last Fall Guy, Speaks Out” (TK News)

James Bradley is the author of Flags of Our Fathers, Flyboys, The China Mirage, and many others. He hosts the podcast, Untold Pacific. Follow him on Twitter @jamesjbradley.

      <title>10/11/21 Andrew Quilty on the Afghan War Criminals being Brought to the United States</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-11-21-andrew-quilty-on-the-afghan-war-criminals-being-brought-to-the-united-states/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Andrew Quilty, a journalist who’s stayed in Kabul, about a recent article he wrote for the Intercept. The article talks about the Zero Units which were militia groups of Afghan commandos led by CIA advisors, or handlers. These units gained notoriety during the war and have been accused of numerous war crimes. Many refer to them as CIA Death Squads. Quilty explains how members of these Death Squads were given priority in the evacuation from Kabul and how they will be resettled in the United States. Quilty also gives his account of how things are in Afghanistan after the U.S. has pulled out.

Discussed on the show:

 	“The CIA’s Afghan Proxis, Accused of War Crimes, will get a Fresh Start in the U.S.” (The Intercept)
 	“The Other Afghan Women” (The New Yorker)
 	No Good Men Among The Living by Anand Gopel
 	“Looser rules, more civilian deaths, a Taliban takeover: Inside America’s failed Afghan drone campaign” (Connecting Vets) 
 	“Surprise, panic and fateful choices: The day America lost its longest war” (Washington Post)


 	BBC reporting about eyewitness claims that soldiers fired into the crowd after the suicide attack. 

Andrew Quilty is an Australian freelance photojournalist and reporter. A winner of Polk and World Press Photo awards, he has been based in Kabul since 2013. Follow him on Twitter or at andrewquilty.com.

      <title>10/8/21 David Vine on the Absurd Number of American Bases Around the World</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-8-21-david-vine-on-the-absurd-number-of-american-bases-around-the-world/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with David Vine about a report he wrote recently for the Quincy Institute along with Patterson Deppen and Leah Bolger. The report makes the case for significantly reducing the number of American military bases abroad. Vine explains that there are currently around 750 active military bases outside of the U.S. And with far less diplomatic foreign infrastructure, America is projecting itself as a global empire that is militaristic above all. Scott and Vine also discuss some of the factors that keep these bases from closing. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Drawdown: Improving U.S. and Global Security Through Military Base Closures Abroad” (Quincy Institute) 
 	Okinawa: Cold War Island by Chalmers Johnson

David Vine is a professor of Anthropology at American University and the author of Island of Shame: The Secret History of the U.S. Military Base on Diego Garcia. He also writes for the New York Times, Washington Post, and The Guardian, among others. Follow him on Twitter @davidsvine.

      <title>10/8/21 John Kiriakou on the Torture of Abu Zubaydah</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-8-21-john-kiriakou-on-the-torture-of-abu-zubaydah/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews former CIA Officer John Kiriakou about a recent article he wrote. Kiriakou was personally involved in the 2002 capture of Abu Zubaydah in Pakistan. At the time, the CIA believed Zubaydah to be Al Qaeda’s third highest-ranking member. In truth, he was simply a logistician. Still, the Bush Administration used Zubaydah to make it look like dangerous terrorists were being captured and were handing over information thanks to “enhanced interrogation techniques.” Scott and Kiriakou observe that the Americans executed Japanese soldiers after WWII for using those very same techniques on American POWs. Kiriakou details the torture that Abu Zubaydah has been put through since his capture, all without a single charge being brought against him. Scott and Kiriakou also discuss other victims of the torture program, some of whom were killed without even being charged. Finally, Kiriakou explains the legal action Zubaydah is attempting to take against certain CIA contractors. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Supreme Court to hear whether Abu Zubaydah’s torture is ‘secret’” (Responsible Statecraft)
 	A Question of Torture by Alfred McCoy
 	Murder at Camp Delta by Joseph Hickman 

John Kiriakou is a former CIA officer and author of The Convenient Terrorist: Two Whistleblowers’ Stories of Torture, Terror, Secret Wars, and CIA Lies and Doing Time Like A Spy. He is the host of Loud and Clear on Sputnik Radio. Follow him on Twitter @JohnKiriakou.

        <![CDATA[Scott interviews former CIA Officer John Kiriakou about a recent article he wrote. Kiriakou was personally involved in the 2002 capture of Abu Zubaydah in Pakistan. At the time, the CIA believed Zubaydah to be Al Qaeda’s third highest-ranking member. In truth, he was simply a logistician. Still, the Bush Administration used Zubaydah to make it look like dangerous terrorists were being captured and were handing over information thanks to “enhanced interrogation techniques.” Scott and Kiriakou observe that the Americans executed Japanese soldiers after WWII for using those very same techniques on American POWs. Kiriakou details the torture that Abu Zubaydah has been put through since his capture, all without a single charge being brought against him. Scott and Kiriakou also discuss other victims of the torture program, some of whom were killed without even being charged. Finally, Kiriakou explains the legal action Zubaydah is attempting to take against certain CIA contractors. <br>

      <title>10/01/21 Gareth Porter on the Media’s Misleading Portrayal of the Taliban</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/10-01-21-gareth-porter-on-the-medias-misleading-portrayal-of-the-taliban/</link>
      <description>Gareth Porter joined Scott on Antiwar Radio to discuss his recent piece at the Gray Zone about the dishonest ways the media has covered the Taliban. Both Scott and Porter agree that the Taliban are not to be considered the good guys, but that the media has a history of pushing a misleading narrative about them to justify war. Scott and Porter reflect on how this has been happening, to some extent, for the Taliban’s entire history, but especially as it relates to the group’s connections with Islamic terrorists. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Corporate media stirred global terror hysteria to push postwar hostility toward new Afghan govt” (The Gray Zone)
 	Peril by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa
 	No Good Men Among the Living by Anand Gopal 
 	Charlie Wilson’s War by George Crile

Gareth Porter is an investigative historian and journalist on the national security state. He is the author of Manufactured Crisis: The Untold Story of the Iran Nuclear Scare and, with John Kiriakou, The CIA Insider’s Guide to the Iran Crisis. Follow him on Twitter @GarethPorter and listen to Gareth’s previous appearances on the Scott Horton Show.

 	“9/11 was a test. The books of the last two decades show how America failed.” (Washington Post)
 	American Raj Liberation Or Domination? by Eric Margolis
 	“Peter Bergen is Mistaken About Bin Laden’s Strategy” (Antiwar.com) 
 	24 - IMDb
 	“The Widowed And The Fatherless” (The American Conservative)

 	Aaron’s Substack
 	Chuck Schumer accidentally blowing the whistle on Russiagate before Trump was even inaugurated 
 	Mueller Report

      <title>9/27/21 James Carden on AUKUS, China and NATO Infighting</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-27-21-james-carden-on-aukus-china-and-nato-infighting/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by James Carden to discuss a possible silver lining to the new and unnecessary anti-China pact between Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. (AUKUS). Tensions broke out within NATO after France was unexpectedly cut off from a previously negotiated submarine deal with Australia. Carden thinks some infighting can do some good if it leads to the end of this out-of-date military alliance that threatens peace rather than preserving it. 

Discussed on the show:

 	Video of Mearsheimer appearing to threaten Australia
 	The Tragedy of Great Power Politics by John Mearsheimer
 	“NATO Needs to Adapt Quickly to Stay Relevant for 2030, Report Urges” (New York Times)

James Carden is the executive editor for the American Committee for US-Russia Accord and former adviser on Russia policy at the US State Department. He is a contributing writer at The Nation.

      <title>9/27/21 Kevin Gosztola on the CIA’s War on Assange, Wikileaks and Journalism Itself</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-27-21-kevin-gosztola-on-the-cias-war-on-assange-wikileaks-and-journalism-itself/</link>
      <description>Kevin Gosztola is back on the show to discuss a recent Yahoo! News article about Assange that went viral. Gosztola thinks the piece contains some good reporting but leans too much on a flawed Russiagate framing. Scott and Gosztola discuss the semantic war our government is waging with attempts to redefine certain journalists as “information brokers” and “non-state hostile intelligence agents.” Gosztola also gives an update on Assange’s situation as his next hearing approaches next month. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Kidnapping, assassination and a London shoot-out: Inside the CIA's secret war plans against WikiLeaks” (Yahoo! News)
 	“The CIA’s War On WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange” (Medium)
 	In Defense of Jullian Assange — OR Books
 	Top Secret America at the Washington Post
 	“UN expert says "collective persecution" of Julian Assange must end now” (ohchr.org) 

Kevin Gosztola is managing editor of Shadowproof. He also produces and co-hosts the weekly podcast, “Unauthorized Disclosure.” Follow him on Twitter @kgosztola.

      <title>9/24/21 Barbara Grant on What Really Happened on the Final Day of the Waco Siege</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-24-21-barbara-grant-on-what-really-happened-on-the-final-day-of-the-waco-siege/</link>
      <description>Scott is joined by Barbara Grant to discuss her new documentary which gives an experts perspective on the infrared footage capture on the final day of the Waco siege.  Grant was busy working on a satellite when it happened in 1993, but she later became interested in the infrared footage featured in the 2000 film Waco: A New Revelation. The footage shows several flashes occurring behind the compound. The film argued that these flashes were gunfire while the Government dismissed them as solar reflections. Grant, who has studied and worked with infrared technology, decided to use her expertise to try and get to the truth. In this interview, she tells Scott about her experience investigating and what she concluded. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“When the Government Lied: Waco's Infrared Deception” (Vimeo)
 	Waco: A New Revelation (IMDb)
 	Waco: Rules of Engagement (IMDb)


 	The FLIR Project

Barbara Grant is an engineer, author, and educator trained in radiometry and remote sensing.

      <title>9/24/21 Barbara Slavin on the True Winner of Iraq War 2</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-24-21-barbara-slavin-on-the-true-winner-of-iraq-war-2/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Barbara Slavin from the Atlantic Council. Slavin recently co-authored an article with Abbas Kadhim about how Iran’s influence in the middle east has grown substantially since the U.S. overthrew Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq. Slavin explains that the U.S. was more supportive of Iraq while they were engaged in a brutal war with Iran in the 80s, because the foreign policy establishment saw Iran as a bigger threat. Of course this changed in the 90s when George Bush Sr. launched a war against Iraq. And then there was the invasion in 2003 that disposed of Saddam. Scott and Slavin reflect on the ridiculous claims from that time arguing that regime change in Iraq would not hand Iran more influence, with some claiming it would weaken Iran by giving the U.S. leverage over the entire region. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Iran ‘won’ the war with Iraq but at a heavy price” (Atlantic Council)
 	Bruce Riedel overheard Bush’s phone call days after 9/11
 	“After Sistani and Khamenei: looming successions will shape the Middle East” (Atlantic Council)
 	A Clean Break 
 	Cheney 1994 interview

Barbara Slavin is director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council. Follow her on Twitter: @BarbaraSlavin1.

      <title>9/17/21 Weimin Chen on Why the Approaching Completion of the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline Is Great News</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-17-21-weimin-chen-on-why-the-approaching-completion-of-the-nord-stream-2-pipeline-is-great-news/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Weimin Chen about his recent article on the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. The pipeline will transport natural gas from Russia to Germany. Chen explains that these two countries have a long history of conflict, so we should see increased economic engagement as a triumph. But of course, that’s not how many in the U.S. government see it. Chen explains that those involved with the project have had to deal with U.S. sanctions since the Obama Administration. Washington has opposed the project both in the name of protecting American gas companies from competition and as a way to avoid giving Russia leverage over Europe. However, the Biden Administration has stopped the sanctions, signaling a change in the American position. Some Europeans themselves oppose the pipeline on environmental grounds. And others are upset they’ll make less collecting fees on gas traveling through their borders. But both Scott and Chen agree that all sides need to consider the risk of thermonuclear war when advocating against economic engagement. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Nord Stream 2: The Value of German-Russian Cooperation” (Austrian Economics Center)

Weimin Chen is a research assistant at the Austrian Economics Center and is a manager and project/events coordinator at the International Student Center’s Arts for Peace Initiative in New York City.

However, the Biden Administration has stopped the sanctions, signaling a change in the American position. Some Europeans themselves oppose the pipeline on environmental grounds. And others are upset they’ll make less collecting fees on gas traveling through their borders. But both Scott and Chen agree that all sides need to consider the risk of thermonuclear war when advocating against economic engagement.

        <![CDATA[Scott talks with Weimin Chen about his recent article on the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. The pipeline will transport natural gas from Russia to Germany. Chen explains that these two countries have a long history of conflict, so we should see increased economic engagement as a triumph. But of course, that’s not how many in the U.S. government see it.

      <title>9/13/21 Aaron Maté on the Seemingly Forgotten American Occupation of Syria</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-13-21-aaron-mate-on-the-seemingly-forgotten-american-occupation-of-syria/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with journalist Aaron Maté about his recent piece bringing attention to the U.S. occupation of Syria. The U.S. military currently controls about a third of Syria with an official troop count of 900. But considering officials were willing to lie to the former president about the real troop numbers, Scott and Maté are skeptical of the official figures. Maté observes that even with bipartisan opposition to these “forever wars” the occupation of Syria remains a subject that’s not to be talked about. Maté has little hope it will come to an end anytime soon. While the official reason given for the military presence is the fight against ISIS, Maté shows that this claim falls apart after a small amount of digging. And that the real reason is to hold economic leverage against the Syrian regime as a way to support Israel in its not-so-cold war with Iran. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“To keep troops in Syria, US leaders are lying like in Afghanistan” (substack)
 	Joe Kent on Tucker
 	Dana Stroul giving the official reason for staying in Syria 
 	Pentagon Report admitting that the U.S. is not fighting ISIS in Syria, contradicting the official narrative
 	“US military ‘owns’ 1/3rd of Syria, boasted top Biden Pentagon official, vowing to block reconstruction of ‘rubble’” (Grayzone) 

Aaron Maté is an NYC-based journalist and producer. He hosts the news show Pushback for The Grayzone, and writes regularly for The Nation. Follow him on Twitter @AaronJMate.

      <title>9/13/21 Mathieu Aikins on the Recent US Drone Strike in Kabul and Life in Afghanistan Post-Withdrawal</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-13-21-mathieu-aikins-on-the-recent-us-drone-strike-in-kabul-and-life-in-afghanistan-post-withdrawal/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews journalist Mathieu Aikins who has remained in Kabul to report for the New York Times. Aikins and his team recently investigated the drone strike the U.S. carried out on August 29th that officials claimed had targeted a car carrying explosives believed to be driven by a member of ISIS. However, the team from NYT found a devastating scene with the bodies of children and a distraught family claiming to have just lost ten family members. Aikins and his colleagues were able to identify the man as Zemari Ahmadi. Ahmadi worked for a California-based aid organization and was trying to get his family on a plane out of Afghanistan when he and many of his children were killed. 

Discussed on the show:

 	 “Times Investigation: In U.S. Drone Strike, Evidence Suggests No ISIS Bomb” (New York Times)
 	“Examining a ‘righteous’ strike” (Washington Post)
 	“The Taliban’s Fight for Hearts and Minds” (Foreign Policy)

Mathieu Aikins is an international freelance journalist currently reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan. His upcoming book is The Naked Don’t Fear the Water: A Journey Through the Refugee Underground. Follow him on Twitter @mattaikins.

      <title>9/9/21 Joe Dyke on the Civilian Bodycount of American Airstrikes</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-9-21-joe-dyke-on-the-civilian-bodycount-of-american-airstrikes/</link>
      <description>Joe Dyke from Airwars.org joins the show to discuss his new report, coauthored with Imogen Piper, which attempts to count civilian deaths resulting directly from U.S. airstrikes during the Terror Wars. Dyke says he and his colleagues want civilian deaths to be part of the broader ongoing discussions about the cost of these wars. Scott and Dyke discuss the difficulties involved with trying to count civilian deaths and examine the costs and benefits of different methods. Both agree, regardless of method, it’s important work. Especially since the U.S. government has made no official estimates. 

Discussed on the show:

 	 “Tens of thousands of civilians likely killed by US in ‘Forever Wars’” (Airwars.org)
 	Cost of War Project at Brown University 
 	“The Other Afghan Women” (New Yorker)
 	“Looser rules, more civilian deaths, a Taliban takeover: Inside America’s failed Afghan drone campaign” (Connecting Vets)
 	“The Drone Papers” (The Intercept) 
 	George W. Bush speech after 9/11 
 	“The Iraq War Logs” (Wikileaks) 
 	 “Iraq war logs reveal 15,000 previously unlisted civilian deaths” (The Guardian) 

Joe Dyke is Senior Investigator at Airwars. He has a decade of experience living and working in the Middle East, carrying out in-depth investigations into conflict-related civilian harm. Follow his work on Twitter @joedyke.

      <title>9/9/21 Dave DeCamp on Developments in Afghanistan and Syria</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-9-21-dave-decamp-on-developments-in-afghanistan-and-syria/</link>
      <description>This week on Antiwar Radio, Scott talked with Dave DeCamp. DeCamp gives an update on Afghanistan where the Taliban are attempting to form a government. Both Scott and DeCamp agree that the Taliban are likely to face difficulties as they try to govern the country, especially if they continue to only appoint Pashtun men to positions of power. Both point to the retaliatory drone strike that killed civilians in Kabul as a preview of what “over the horizon” operations will look like if Biden is serious about continuing them. Lastly, DeCamp provides an update on Syria where insiders appear to be happy with the status quo. And both Scott and DeCamp point to northern Syria as a perfect example of Washington’s hypocrisy on “terrorist safe-havens.” 

Discussed on the show:

 	Bill Roggio at the Long War Journal
 	Emily Horne’s statement about Taliban cooperation
 	 “Tens of thousands of civilians likely killed by US in ‘Forever Wars’” (Airwars.org)
 	“The Other Afghan Women” (New Yorker)
 	“Looser rules, more civilian deaths, a Taliban takeover: Inside America’s failed Afghan drone campaign” (Connecting Vets)

        <![CDATA[This week on Antiwar Radio, Scott talked with Dave DeCamp. DeCamp gives an update on Afghanistan where the Taliban are attempting to form a government. Both Scott and DeCamp agree that the Taliban are likely to face difficulties as they try to govern the country, especially if they continue to only appoint Pashtun men to positions of power. Both point to the retaliatory drone strike that killed civilians in Kabul as a preview of what “over the horizon” operations will look like if Biden is serious about continuing them. Lastly, DeCamp provides an update on Syria where insiders appear to be happy with the status quo. And both Scott and DeCamp point to northern Syria as a perfect example of Washington’s hypocrisy on “terrorist safe-havens.” <br>

      <title>9/6/21 Clive Stafford Smith on Ahmed Rabbani and the Other Innocent Men Being Held at Guantanamo Bay</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-6-21-clive-stafford-smith-on-ahmed-rabbani-and-the-other-innocent-men-being-held-at-guantanamo-bay/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Clive Stafford Smith about a recent article written by his client Ahmed Rabbani. Rabbani has been in custody for 19 years without a single charge being brought against him. In 2002 he found himself in the hands of the CIA who allegedly believed he was a man named Hassan Ghul. But even after the real Ghul was captured and brought to the same prison Rabbani was being kept in, the CIA kept trying to extract information from Rabbani. Ghul cooperated and was freed. But Rabbani was sent to Guantanamo Bay where he remains today. Smith explains some of the difficulties facing him as he argues Rabbani’s case and sheds some light on how common his story really is.

Discussed on the show:

 	“The U.S. Has Held Me For 19 Years Without A Charge. I Have Just One Chance To Be Freed” (Huffington Post)
 	The Senate Torture Report

Clive Stafford Smith is founder of Reprieve, and is now director of his new non-profit the 3DCentre. He is the author of Bad Men: Guantánamo Bay and the Secret Prisons and Injustice: Life and Death in the Courtrooms of America. Follow him on Twitter @CliveSSmith.

      <title>9/3/21 Coleen Rowley on the Many Ways 9/11 Could Have Been Prevented</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-3-21-coleen-rowley-on-the-many-ways-9-11-could-have-been-prevented/</link>
      <description>Scott speaks with FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley about the institutional failures that occurred before and after the 9/11 attacks. Rowley believes that there are many ways the attacks could have been prevented ranging from better information sharing between agencies to the locking of cockpit doors. After the attacks, Rowley says bureaucratic changes alone would have been enough to prevent similar attacks from occurring again and been a lot less costly than launching wars and spying on the world’s population. But both Scott and Rowley observe that instead the tragedy was seized upon by people with predefined agendas, something they both find just as morally reprehensible as prior knowledge of the attacks. 

Discussed on the show:

 	Pete Seeger: Waist Deep in the Big Muddy
 	The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright
 	Press For Truth Movie
 	Ray Nowosielski interview with Richard Clarke
 	The Shadow Factory by James Bamford 
 	Coleen Rowley’s Memo to FBI Director Robert Mueller
 	Her second letter to Mueller, right before the invasion of Iraq in 2003
 	The Fall by Camus 

Coleen Rowley is a retired FBI agent and lawyer who helped expose the FBI’s pre-9/11 failures. She was honored with TIME magazine’s “Person of the Year” in 2002. Find her on Twitter @ColeenRowley.

      <title>9/3/21 Danny Sjursen on Afghanistan, Veterans and Counterinsurgency</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-3-21-danny-sjursen-on-afghanistan-veterans-and-counterinsurgency/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews Danny Sjursen and gets his reaction to the Taliban victory in Afghanistan. Sjursen thinks the Taliban’s campaign to take control of the country may soon be studied in war colleges. He also thinks that Scott’s book Fool’s Errand should be studied at war colleges, or at least books just as critical of the wars. Sjursen then talks about how this is a tough time for veterans, but that that isn’t a reason to hold back criticism of the war. That the idea that being antiwar implies a hatred of the troops is ridiculous and convenient for those in power.  Lastly, Sjursen reflects on the counterinsurgency mission he took part in Afghanistan.

Discussed on the show:

 	The Hunt for Red October
 	Redeployment by Phil Klay 
 	“American Purpose After the Fall of Kabul” (New Yorker)
 	Curb Your Enthusiasm clip 
 	The Operators by Michael Hastings 
 	War Machine 
 	Reign of Terror by Spencer Ackerman 

Danny Sjursen is a retired U.S. army major and former history instructor at West Point. He is the author of Ghost Riders of Baghdad: Soldiers, Civilians, and the Myth of the Surge, Patriotic Dissent: America in the Age of Endless War and A True History of the United States: Indigenous Genocide, Racialized Slavery, Hyper-Capitalism, Militarist Imperialism and Other Overlooked Aspects of American Exceptionalism.

      <title>9/3/21 Gareth Porter on the Media’s Reaction to the Withdrawal From Afghanistan</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-3-21-gareth-porter-on-medias-reaction-to-the-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/</link>
      <description>Gareth Porter joins Scott on Antiwar Radio to discuss his latest piece about the media’s reaction to Afghanistan. Porter lays out how virtually the entire media ecosystem is arguing the withdrawal was done prematurely from both a counterterrorism standpoint and in terms of the evacuation of American citizens and allies. However, the media is ignoring the root of the problem was the overconfidence the U.S. Military and Intelligence Community had in the Afghan National Army. Porter argues that that is where the blame ought to lie, rather than squarely on Biden. Now Porter thinks we’ve reached an inflection point, with historic calls for those responsible for these disastrous wars to be held accountable. 

Discussed on the show:

 	Gareth Porter’s page at the Grayzone
 	“Afghanistan collapse reveals Beltway media’s loyalty to permanent war state” (Grazone)
 	news.antiwar.com — better than CIA briefings according to Chalmers Johnson
 	“Surprise, panic and fateful choices: The day America lost its longest war” (Washington Post)
 	“Top defense firms spend $1B on lobbying during Afghan war, see $2T return” (Responsible Statecraft)
 	Joe Kent on Tucker

Gareth Porter is an investigative historian and journalist on the national security state. He is the author of Manufactured Crisis: The Untold Story of the Iran Nuclear Scare and, with John Kiriakou, The CIA Insider’s Guide to the Iran Crisis.

      <title>9/3/21 Dan McKnight on Defend the Guard and the Withdrawal From Afghanistan</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/9-3-21-dan-mcknight-on-defend-the-guard-and-the-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Dan McKnight about the effort to pass Defend the Guard legislation, which would block the use of National Guard troops in foreign combat operations without a declaration of war. McKnight gives background on what led him to become involved in political activism and how the absence of the Louisiana National Guard during Hurricane Ida is yet another reason for this legislation. Scott and McKnight also talk about the value veterans bring to the movement to end wars. Lastly, McKnight explains that despite being relieved the war is over, he believes the Afghanistan withdrawal was handled disgracefully. 

Discussed on the show:

 	Bring Our Troops Home
 	Defend the Guard

Dan McKnight is the founder and Chairman of Idahoans to Bring Our Troops Home. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves, three years active duty with the U.S. Army and ten years with the Idaho Army National Guard, including a one-year deployment to Afghanistan in 2006.

      <title>8/30/21 Jack Murphy on America’s Failed Drone Campaign in Afghanistan</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-30-21-jack-murphy-on-americas-failed-drone-campaign-in-afghanistan/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Jack Murphy about the piece he wrote detailing the surge in drone strikes that took place under President Trump.  Murphy explains how the whole project started when a distraught drone operator approached him. It quickly became clear that that drone operator was not alone. Murphy details how Rules of Engagement (ROE) are formulated and how they evolved during the Obama and Trump presidencies. This leads to a discussion of the ruthless drone campaign that the U.S. carried out against the Taliban during negotiations. A campaign that killed numerous Afghan men for the crime of simply using a radio. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Looser rules, more civilian deaths, a Taliban takeover: Inside America’s failed Afghan drone campaign” (Audacy)
 	“The Uncounted” (New York Times)
 	Rand Corporation Study on Limited Intervention 

Jack Murphy is an eight-year Army Special Operations veteran. After returning to civilian life in 2010, he graduated from Columbia University in 2014 with a bachelor’s degree in political science. Find his memoir here and follow him on Twitter @JackMurphyRGR

      <title>8/27/21 Ashraf Nubani on Why Sirhan Sirhan, the Man Convicted for Killing Robert Kennedy, Ought to Be Released</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-27-21-ashraf-nubani-on-why-sirhan-sirhan-the-man-convicted-for-killing-robert-kennedy-ought-to-be-released/</link>
      <description>Scott interviews attorney and writer Ashraf Nubani about his recent piece making a case for releasing Robert Kennedy’s convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan. Nubani explains that Sirhan meets all the stated requirements of the parole board and that the pressure to keep him in prison is mainly political. 

Note: This interview was recorded hours before the news broke that the California Parole Board recommended Sirhan’s release. Governor Newsom’s office will now review the case and can still block parole. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“It’s time for Sirhan Sirhan to go free” (The Electronic Intifada)
 	“Sirhan Sirhan, convicted of Robert F. Kennedy assassination, seeks parole with no opposition from prosecutors” (Washington Post)

Ashraf W. Nubani is an attorney and a Palestinian American and Muslim community leader in the Washington, DC, metro area.

      <title>8/27/21 Daniel Davis on the Kabul Airport Bombing</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-27-21-daniel-davis-on-the-kabul-airport-bombing/</link>
      <description>Scott speaks with Daniel Davis about the suicide bombing at the entrance to the Kabul Airport. Davis considers this an especially devastating attack because the soldiers killed were only days away from being withdrawn from the country. He also believes that these withdrawal issues could have been prevented if U.S. troops had left a decade ago instead of flooding the country as they did under Obama’s surge. Davis goes on to explain why he has no respect for those who lie to the families of dead soldiers about what they died fighting for, all while sending new soldiers off to the same pointless mission. Finally, Davis takes on the argument that we should never have given up Bagram Air Base, and he explains why taking it back now would be disastrous. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Looser rules, more civilian deaths, a Taliban takeover: Inside America’s failed Afghan drone campaign” (Audacy)

Daniel Davis did multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan during his time in the army. He writes a weekly column for National Interest and is the author of the reports “Dereliction of Duty II: Senior Military Leaders’ Loss of Integrity Wounds Afghan War Effort” and “Go Big or Go Deep: An Analysis of Strategy Options on Afghanistan.” Find him on Twitter @DanielLDavis1.

      <itunes:summary>Scott speaks with Daniel Davis about the suicide bombing at the entrance to the Kabul Airport. Davis considers this an especially devastating attack because the soldiers killed were only days away from being withdrawn from the country. He also believes that these withdrawal issues could have been prevented if U.S. troops had left a decade ago instead of flooding the country as they did under Obama’s surge. Davis goes on to explain why he has no respect for those who lie to the families of dead soldiers about what they died fighting for, all while sending new soldiers off to the same pointless mission. Finally, Davis takes on the argument that we should never have given up Bagram Air Base, and he explains why taking it back now would be disastrous. 

Discussed on the show:

 	“Looser rules, more civilian deaths, a Taliban takeover: Inside America’s failed Afghan drone campaign” (Audacy)

Daniel Davis did multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan during his time in the army. He writes a weekly column for National Interest and is the author of the reports “Dereliction of Duty II: Senior Military Leaders’ Loss of Integrity Wounds Afghan War Effort” and “Go Big or Go Deep: An Analysis of Strategy Options on Afghanistan.” Find him on Twitter @DanielLDavis1.

      <title>8/27/21 Peter Van Buren: There Will Be Another Afghanistan</title>
      <link>https://scotthorton.org/interviews/8-27-21-peter-van-buren-there-will-be-another-afghanistan/</link>
      <description>Scott talks with Peter Van Buren about the situation in Afghanistan.  Van Buren explains that many of the people tasked with working on the Afghanistan War were, in fact, working to cover up their own role in the war. And that these individual failures played off each other to create one massive failure. On top of that, Van Buren argues that policymakers were entirely removed from the costs of the war. And because of that, Van Buren predicts we will soon find ourselves in a similar conflict.

Discussed on the show:

 	We Meant Well by Peter Van Buren
 	The Ghost of Tom Joad by Peter Van Buren
 	Hooper’s War by Peter Van Buren
 	Van Buren’s blog 
 	“Nation-Building, the Washington Generals of Warfare Strangely Preferred by Washington Generals” (American Spectator)
 	NPR interview Van Buren about his book We Meant Well
 	Terry Gross’ interview with CNN’s Clarissa Ward
 	The Best and the Brightest by David Halberstam
 	Obama’s Wars by Bob Woodward

Peter Van Buren worked for 24 years at the Department of State including a year in Iraq. He is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People and the novel Hooper’s War. He is now a contributing editor at The American Conservative magazine.
